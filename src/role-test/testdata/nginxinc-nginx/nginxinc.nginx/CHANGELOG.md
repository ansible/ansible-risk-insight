## 0.22.0 (December 9, 2021)

BREAKING CHANGES:

* The `nginx_state` variable has been replaced with `nginx_setup` and instead of using `present`, `absent`, `latest` you should now use `install`, `uninstall` and `upgrade`.
* `nginx_install` variable is no more. Use `nginx_enable` instead.
* Ansible core `2.12` is now a minimum requirement for the role.

FEATURES:

* Pin repository data when installing NGINX OSS on Alpine and Debian distributions.

* Update the Molecule tests to include the newly supported distributions and remove distributions that are no longer supported for NGINX OSS and NGINX Plus.
* Bump the Ansible `community.general` collection to `3.7.0`, `ansible.posix` collection to `1.3.0` and `community.docker` collection to `1.9.1`.

## 0.21.0 (August 11, 2021)

BREAKING CHANGES:

Remove the deprecation warning in the README detailing the advent of the [NGINX Core Ansible collection](https://github.com/nginxinc/ansible-collection-nginx) and the subsequent splitting from this role of the [Ansible NGINX Config role](https://github.com/nginxinc/ansible-role-nginx-config) and the [Ansible NGINX Unit role](https://github.com/nginxinc/ansible-role-nginx-unit).

FEATURES:

* Add a `nginx_manage_repo` feature flag which allows disabling NGINX repo management by this role.
* Add a `nginx_install_epel_release` feature flag which allows epel-release to not be installed by this role if so desired.

ENHANCEMENTS:

Bump the Ansible `community.general` collection to `3.5.0` and `community.docker` collection to `1.9.0`.

## 0.20.0 (June 9, 2021)

BREAKING CHANGES:

* The NGINX Plus repository has been updated. This might cause some issues when running the role on an instance that already has NGINX Plus installed. **Starting with NGINX Plus R25, you will need to install NGINX Plus using release `0.20.0`. If you are trying to install R23, please use release `0.19.2`. NGINX Plus R24 should work with both release `0.19.2` and `0.20.0`.**
* The NGINX Plus modsecurity module is no longer supported by this role. Until NGINX Plus R25 is released, you might keep using release `0.19.2` if you wish to install modsecurity.

ENHANCEMENTS:

* Replace Ansible base with Ansible core. Ansible core will be the "core" Ansible release moving forward from Ansible `2.11`.
* Update GitHub actions to add a workflow dispatch option.
* Replace "yes"/"no" boolean values with "true"/"false" to comply with YAML spec `1.2`.
* Bump the Ansible `community.general` collection to `3.2.0` and `community.docker` collection to `1.7.0`.

BUG FIXES:

Change the url used to grep the latest NGINX version when installing from source. This should avoid the source install failing whenever the `stable` release is higher than the latest `mainline`.

## 0.19.2 (April 28, 2021)

FEATURES:

* Replace Ansible community distribution with Ansible base and add the necessary extra collections as a dependency requirement. For reference, these are:

    ```yaml
    ---
    collections:
      - name: community.general
        version: 3.0.0
      - name: ansible.posix
        version: 1.2.0
      - name: community.docker  # This collection is only used as part of the Molecule testing suite
        version: 1.5.0
    ```

* Explicitly list Jinja2 `2.11.3` as a requirement, as well as detail the minimum supported version (`2.11.x`).
* Add support for Dependabot.
* Initial implementation of Release Drafter.

ENHANCEMENTS:

* Only run GitHub actions Galaxy CI/CD workflow when a new release is published.
* Add Alpine `3.13` to the list of NGINX Plus supported platforms.
* Specify GitHub actions Ubuntu release.
* Minor GitHub template tweaks, including the creation of a SECURITY doc.
* Add Molecule NGINX OSS tests for Alpine 3.13, remove Molecule tests for Debian stretch, and update list of supported platforms.
* Update Ansible base to `2.10.8`, Ansible Lint to `5.0.7`, Molecule to `3.3.0`, yamllint to `1.26.1` and Docker Python SDK to `5.0.0`.
* Consolidate Molecule testing scenarios to address changes introduced in Ansible Lint `5.*`.
* Override of systemd `Restart` value by using proper `nginx_service_restart` variable.

BUG FIXES:

* Add `state` parameter to package module in Molecule verification tests.
* Change the command directory when running the NGINX configuration check handler to prevent edge case errors when the handler is run from a directory that the NGINX process' user does not have access to.

## 0.19.1 (January 11, 2021)

ENHANCEMENTS:

* The GitHub actions Molecule CI/CD workflow should now correctly avoid running 'plus' related tests on external PRs.
* Update Ansible base to `2.10.4`, Ansible to `2.10.5`, Molecule to `3.2.2` and Docker Python SDK to `4.4.1`.
* Update copyright notice.

## 0.19.0 (December 23, 2020)

BREAKING CHANGES:

**The NGINX configuration functionalities included in this role have been removed as of release 0.19.0.** There now is a separate role to manage and create NGINX configurations available [here](https://github.com/nginxinc/ansible-role-nginx-config). Any new issues or PRs related to configuring NGINX should be submitted in the new NGINX configuration Ansible role repository. New issues or PRs related to configuring NGINX submitted in this repository will not be worked on.

ENHANCEMENTS:

The GitHub actions Molecule CI/CD workflow is no longer run on a new release (this is not necessary since it already runs on every push).

## 0.18.2 (December 22, 2020)

ENHANCEMENTS:

* Update Molecule to `3.2.1` and Docker Python SDK to `4.4.0`.
* Add Alpine `3.12` to supported platforms for NGINX Plus.

BUG FIXES:

Fix issue whereas SELinux state would not be correctly set back to `enforcing` when `nginx_selinux: true`.

## 0.18.0 (November 13, 2020)

BREAKING CHANGES:

**The NGINX Unit functionalities included in this role have been removed as of release 0.18.0.** There now is a separate role to install NGINX Unit available [here](https://github.com/nginxinc/ansible-role-nginx-unit). Any new issues or PRs related to NGINX Unit should be submitted in the new NGINX Unit Ansible role repository. New issues or PRs related to NGINX Unit submitted in this repository will not be worked on.

## 0.17.4 (November 12, 2020)

ENHANCEMENTS:

Implement a new syntax to specify modules to be installed. You can now use the following format if you want further fine grained control over how you install modules:

```yaml
- name: njs  # Required
  state: present  # Optional
  version: =1.19.4+0.4.4-1~bionic  # Optional
```

The old method of specifying modules (using a list of names) still works as expected.

## 0.17.3 (November 9, 2020)

ENHANCEMENTS:

* Add survey to README.
* Improve README structure and use tables where relevant.
* Update Ansible (now Ansible base) to `2.10.3`, Ansible (now Ansible Community Distribution) to `2.10.3`, Ansible Lint to `4.3.7`, Molecule to `3.1.5`, and yamllint to `1.25.0`.

BUG FIXES:

Fix an issue where sometimes the role handlers will fail in distros where NGINX is not started upon installation.

## 0.17.1 (September 22, 2020)

ENHANCEMENTS:

* The role will no longer fail automatically on unsupported platforms, but the error message will still be displayed.
* The `Check NGINX` handler now always outputs an `ok` state instead of `changed` since it's a read-only operation with no traceable changes.

## 0.17.0 (September 20, 2020)

BREAKING CHANGES:

* The process to install modules has changed. You will now have to use a list variable, `nginx_modules`, instead of manually setting the modules you want to install to `true` or `false`. This change will also simplify adding future supported modules to this role. You can find a list of supported modules for NGINX and NGINX Plus in [`vars/main.yml`](https://github.com/nginxinc/ansible-role-nginx/blob/main/vars/main.yml).
* Modules can no longer be added to your NGINX config using this role. Please use the [`nginx_config`](https://github.com/nginxinc/ansible-role-nginx-config) role instead.
* Changed `nginx_configure` default value from `true` to `false` to further promote the adoption of the [NGINX config](https://github.com/nginxinc/ansible-role-nginx-config) role.

FEATURES:

* A new variable has been introduced:
  * `nginx_setup_license` -- Determine whether you want to use this role to upload your NGINX license to your target host.
* The role will now fail automatically if you try to deploy NGINX from an official repository in an unsupported distribution. You can find a list of supported distributions for NGINX and NGINX Plus in [`vars/main.yml`](https://github.com/nginxinc/ansible-role-nginx/blob/main/vars/main.yml)
* Three new tags have been introduced -- `nginx_setup_license`, `nginx_enable` and `nginx_check_support`.
* Add Alpine 3.12 to the list of supported platforms.
* Remove Alpine 3.8 from the list of supported platforms.
* Add NGINX Plus tests to TravisCI

ENHANCEMENTS:

* Added handlers to check for NGINX syntax validity and fail if any errors are detected.
* Switch to using `ansible_facts` wherever possible.
* Major backend refactoring to reduce the number of files and tasks.
* You can now specify an `nginx_repository` for NGINX Plus too.
* Moved "constant" variables to `vars/main.yml`.
* Included deprecation warnings in task names and files.
* Improved tasks naming conventions.
* Update Ansible to `2.9.13` and Ansible Lint to `4.3.5`.

BUG FIXES:

* NGINX Plus repository data for RHEL based distros is now appropriately set.
* Building NGINX from source should now work as expected in CentOS/RHEL 6 systems running Python `2.6` or earlier versions of `2.7`.

## 0.16.0 (August 28, 2020)

BREAKING CHANGES:

The Debian and Ubuntu repositories have slightly changed. You may run into some duplication issues when running the role on a preexisting target that already has had NGINX installed using the role. To fix this, manually remove the old repository source.

ENHANCEMENTS:

* Update Ansible to `2.9.12` and Ansible Lint to `4.3.2`.
* Explicitly define `mode` in relevant tasks.
* Explicitly define the `nginx` `apt_repository` filename in Debian based distros.

FEATURES:

TravisCI now always uses the latest version of Docker.

BUG FIXES:

Building OpenSSL from source should now work properly in CentOS 8.

## 0.15.0 (August 20, 2020)

DEPRECATION WARNING:

With the advent of Ansible collections and to reduce the overhead of this role, the decision has been made to split this role into three smaller roles:

* The NGINX Ansible role will keep working as is and be used to install and setup NGINX.
* There now is a separate role to manage and create NGINX configurations available [here](https://github.com/nginxinc/ansible-role-nginx-config). Any new issues or PRs related to configuring NGINX should be submitted in the new NGINX Config repository. New issues or PRs related to configuring NGINX submitted in this repository will not be worked on. The NGINX configuration functionalities included in this role will be removed in an upcoming release.
* NGINX Unit now has a separate role available [here](https://github.com/nginxinc/ansible-role-nginx-unit). Any new issues or PRs related to NGINX Unit should be submitted in the new NGINX Unit repository. New issues or PRs related to NGINX Unit submitted in this repository will not be worked on. The NGINX Unit functionalities included in this role will be removed in an upcoming release.

BREAKING CHANGES:

* The Debian and Ubuntu repositories have slightly changed. You may run into some duplication issues when running the role on a preexisting target that already has had NGINX installed using the role. To fix this, manually remove the old repository source.
* If you use `custom_options` you will now need to manually end each directive with a semicolon.
* The `status` directive is no longer supported in NGINX Plus, and the `stub_status` directive has been reworked into a template.
* The listen directive structure in the `stream` template has been updated to the listen directive structure found in the `http` template. You can now specify multiple `listen` directives in the same `server` block as well as include any extra `listen` options you might need.

    Old configuration example

    ```yaml
    listen_address: localhost
    listen_port: 80
    udp_enable: false
    ```

    New configuration example

    ```yaml
    listen:
      listen_localhost:
        ip: 0.0.0.0  # Wrap in square brackets for IPv6 addresses
        port: 80
        ssl: false
        opts: []  # Listen opts like udp which will be added (ssl is automatically added if you specify 'ssl:').
    ```

    The one major change is that instead of using `udp_enable: true` you will now need to use `opts: [udp]` if you wish to enable `udp`.

FEATURES:

* Add support to configure logrotate.
* Add support for Ubuntu Focal.
* Add support to configure SELinux.
* Two new variables have been introduced -- `nginx_enable` and `nginx_configure` -- to let you choose whether you want to install NGINX, configure NGINX, or both.

ENHANCEMENTS:

* Molecule tests using Testinfra have been migrated to use Ansible instead.
* The role now uses `include_tasks` instead of `import_tasks` when possible to speed up the role's execution time.
* Improve configuration cleanup capabilities. You can now remove all `*.conf` files in a given directory, or specify a list of files you wish to delete.
* Improve configuration templating capabilities:
  * Add support for unix upstreams.
  * Add PID templating option.
  * Add support for down parameter in upstreams.
  * Add option for custom error pages.
  * Add SSL support to `stream` contexts.

BUG FIXES:

* `nginx_debug_output` would sometimes fail if NGINX had not been automatically started by the system upon installation.
* If `http_demo_conf` was undefined the web server template interpolation would fail.

## 0.14.0 (April 22, 2020)

This is a relatively minor release, but it includes a potential breaking change (hence the version bump). The one major new feature is the ability to install/build NGINX Open Source from source.
