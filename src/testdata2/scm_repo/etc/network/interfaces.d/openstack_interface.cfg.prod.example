# This is a multi-NIC bonded configuration to implement the required bridges
# for OpenStack-Ansible. This illustrates the configuration of the first
# Infrastructure host and the IP addresses assigned should be adapted
# for implementation on the other hosts.
#
# After implementing this configuration, the host will need to be
# rebooted.

# Assuming that eth0/1 and eth2/3 are dual port NIC's we pair
# eth0 with eth2 and eth1 with eth3 for increased resiliency
# in the case of one interface card failing.
