    Note that the upgrade targets impacting the data

    control plane can experience some down time.

    and given that the tests implemented for it are
    not monitored as well as those for a greenfield
    environment, the results may vary with each release.

    Please use it against a test environment with your
    configurations to validate whether it suits your
    needs and does a suitable upgrade.

    Are you ready to perform this upgrade now?
