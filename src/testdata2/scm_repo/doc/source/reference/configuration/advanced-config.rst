The OpenStack-Ansible project provides a basic OpenStack environment, but
many deployers will wish to extend the environment based on their needs. This
could include installing extra services, changing package versions, or
overriding existing variables.

Using these extension points, deployers can provide a more 'opinionated'
installation of OpenStack that may include their own software.
