Understanding the inventory
===========================

The default layout of containers and services in OpenStack-Ansible (OSA) is
determined by the ``/etc/openstack_deploy/openstack_user_config.yml`` file and
the contents of both the ``/etc/openstack_deploy/conf.d/`` and
``/etc/openstack_deploy/env.d/`` directories. You use these sources to define
the *group* mappings that the playbooks use to target hosts and containers for
roles used in the deploy.

* You define host groups, which gather the target hosts into *inventory
  groups*, through the ``/etc/openstack_deploy/openstack_user_config.yml``
  file and the contents of the ``/etc/openstack_deploy/conf.d/`` directory.

* You define *container groups*, which can map from the service components
  to be deployed up to host groups, through files in the
  ``/etc/openstack_deploy/env.d/`` directory.

To customize the layout of the components for your deployment, modify the
host groups and container groups appropriately before running the installation
playbooks.

.. _inventory-confd:

Understanding host groups (conf.d structure)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As part of the initial configuration, each target host appears either in the
``/etc/openstack_deploy/openstack_user_config.yml`` file or in files within
the ``/etc/openstack_deploy/conf.d/`` directory. The format used for files in
the ``conf.d/`` directory is identical to the syntax used in the
``openstack_user_config.yml`` file.

In these files, the target hosts are listed under one or more
headings, such as ``shared-infra_hosts`` or ``storage_hosts``, which serve as
Ansible group mappings. These groups map to the physical
hosts.

The ``haproxy.yml.example`` file in the ``conf.d/`` directory provides
a simple example of defining a host group (``haproxy_hosts``) with two hosts
(``infra1`` and ``infra2``).

The ``swift.yml.example`` file provides a more complex example. Here, host
variables for a target host are specified by using the ``container_vars`` key.
OpenStack-Ansible applies all entries under this key as host-specific
variables to any component containers on the specific host.

.. note::

   To manage file size, we recommend that you define new inventory groups,
   particularly for new services, by using a new file in the
   ``conf.d/`` directory.

.. _inventory-envd:

Understanding container groups (env.d structure)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Additional group mappings are located within files in the
``/etc/openstack_deploy/env.d/`` directory. These groups are treated as
virtual mappings from the host groups (described above) onto the container
groups, that define where each service deploys. By reviewing files within the
``env.d/`` directory, you can begin to see the nesting of groups represented
in the default layout.

For example, the ``shared-infra.yml`` file defines a container group,
``shared-infra_containers``, as a subset of the ``all_containers``
inventory group. The ``shared- infra_containers`` container group is
mapped to the ``shared-infra_hosts`` host group. All of the service
components in the ``shared-infra_containers`` container group are
deployed to each target host in the ``shared-infra_hosts host`` group.

Within a ``physical_skel`` section, the OpenStack-Ansible dynamic inventory
expects to find a pair of keys. The first key maps to items in the
``container_skel`` section, and the second key maps to the target host groups
(described above) that are responsible for hosting the service component.

To continue the example, the ``memcache.yml`` file defines the
``memcache_container`` container group. This group is a subset of the
``shared-infra_containers`` group, which is itself a subset of
the ``all_containers`` inventory group.

.. note::

   The ``all_containers`` group is automatically defined by OpenStack-Ansible.
   Any service component managed by OpenStack-Ansible maps to a subset of the
   ``all_containers`` inventory group, directly or indirectly through
   another intermediate container group.

The default layout does not rely exclusively on groups being subsets of other
groups. The ``memcache`` component group is part of the ``memcache_container``
group, as well as the ``memcache_all`` group and also contains a ``memcached``
component group. If you review the ``playbooks/memcached-install.yml``
playbook, you see that the playbook applies to hosts in the ``memcached``
group. Other services might have more complex deployment needs. They define and
consume inventory container groups differently. Mapping components to several
groups in this way allows flexible targeting of roles and tasks.
