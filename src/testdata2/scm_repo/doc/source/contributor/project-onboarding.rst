==================
Project Onboarding
==================

This document should help you understand how to contribute to
OpenStack-Ansible.

Project repositories
====================

The OpenStack-Ansible project has different kinds of git repositories,
each of them with specific use cases, and different sets of practices.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Repository type or name
     - Code location
     - Repository purpose
   * - | **OpenStack-Ansible**
       | Also called *integrated repository*
     - * https://github.com/openstack/openstack-ansible
     - Our main repository, used by deployers.
       Uses the other repositories.
   * - | The **OpenStack-Ansible roles** repositories
     - * https://github.com/openstack/openstack-ansible-os_nova
       * https://github.com/openstack/openstack-ansible-os_glance
       * https://github.com/openstack/ansible-role-systemd_mount
       * https://github.com/openstack/ansible-config_template
       * https://github.com/openstack/ansible-hardening
       * ...
     - Each role is in charge of deploying **exactly one**
       component of an OpenStack-Ansible deployment.
   * - | The **tests repository**
     - * https://github.com/openstack/openstack-ansible-tests
     - | The tests repository is the location for common code used in
         the integrated repo and role repos tests.
       | It allows us to not repeat ourselves: it is the location of
         common playbooks, common tasks and scripts.
   * - | The **specs** repository
     - * https://github.com/openstack/openstack-ansible-specs
     - This repository contains all the information concerning
       large bodies of work done in OpenStack-Ansible,
       split by cycle.
   * - | The **ops** repository
     - * https://github.com/openstack/openstack-ansible-ops
     - This repository is an incubator for new projects, each project
       solving a particular operational problem. Each project has its
       own folder in this repository.
   * - | External repositories
     - * https://github.com/ceph/ceph-ansible
       * https://github.com/logan2211/ansible-resolvconf
       * https://github.com/willshersystems/ansible-sshd
       * https://github.com/opendaylight/integration-packaging-ansible-opendaylight
       * https://github.com/evrardjp/ansible-keepalived
       * ...
     - OpenStack-Ansible is not re-inventing the wheel, and tries to
       reuse as much as possible existing roles. A bugfix for one of
       those repositories must be handled to these repositories'
       maintainers.

How to contribute on code or issues
===================================

* For contributing code and documentation, you must follow the
  OpenStack practices. Nothing special is required for OpenStack-Ansible.

  See also the `OpenStack developers getting started page`_.
  and our :ref:`contributor guidelines<contributing>` before hacking.

* For helping on or submitting bugs, you must have an account on
  ubuntu Launchpad.
  All our repositories share the same `Launchpad project`_.

  Please check our :ref:`bug report<bug_reporting>` and
  :ref:`bug triage<bug_triage>` processes.

  Easy to fix bugs are marked with the tag *low hanging fruit*, and
  should be the target of first time contributors.

* For sharing your user experience, stories, and helping other users,
  please join us in our :ref:`IRC channel<irc>`.

* The OpenStack-Ansible project has recurring tasks that need
  attention, like releasing, or other code duties.
  See our page :ref:`Periodic work<periodicwork>`.
