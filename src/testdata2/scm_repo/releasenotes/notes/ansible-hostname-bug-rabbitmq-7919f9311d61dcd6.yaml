    There is currently an Ansible bug in regards to ``HOSTNAME``. If
    the host ``.bashrc`` holds a var named ``HOSTNAME``, the container where the
    ``lxc_container`` module attaches will inherit this var and potentially
    set the wrong ``$HOSTNAME``. See
    `the Ansible fix <https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/22246>`_ which will be released
    in Ansible version 2.3.
