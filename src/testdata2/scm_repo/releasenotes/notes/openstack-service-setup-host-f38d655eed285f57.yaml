    The openrc role will no longer be executed on all OpenStack
    service containers/hosts. Instead a single host is designated
    through the use of the ``openstack_service_setup_host``
    variable. The default is ``localhost`` (the deployment host).
    Deployers can opt to change this to the utility container by
    implementing the following override in ``user_variables.yml``.

    .. code-block:: yaml

      openstack_service_setup_host: "{{ groups['utility_all'][0] }}"
