features:
  - New hypervisor groups have been added allowing deployers to
    better define their compute workloads. While the generic
    "compute_hosts" group will still work explicit definitions
    for compute hosts can now be defined using the
    `ironic-compute_hosts`, `kvm-compute_hosts`, `lxd-compute_hosts`,
    `qemu-compute_hosts`, and `powervm-compute_hosts` groups
    accordingly
