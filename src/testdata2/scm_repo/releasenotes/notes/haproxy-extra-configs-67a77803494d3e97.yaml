features:
  - Added a new ``haproxy_extra_services`` var which will allow extra haproxy
    endpoint additions.
deprecations:
  - Moved ``haproxy_service_configs`` var to ``haproxy_default_service_configs``
    so that ``haproxy_service_configs`` can be modified and added to without
    overriding the entire default service dict.
