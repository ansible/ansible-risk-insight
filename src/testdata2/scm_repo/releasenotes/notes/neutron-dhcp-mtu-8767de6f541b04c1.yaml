upgrade:
  - As described in the `Mitaka release notes
    <http://docs.openstack.org/releasenotes/neutron/mitaka.html>`_
    Neutron now correctly calculates for and advertises the MTU to
    instances. The default DHCP configuration to advertise an MTU
    to instances has therefore been removed from the variable
    ``neutron_dhcp_config``.
