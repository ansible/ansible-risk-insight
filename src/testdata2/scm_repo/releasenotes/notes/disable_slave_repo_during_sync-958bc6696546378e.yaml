fixes:
  - Containers might fail to retrieve packages from the repo server
    when connecting to a slave repo server that has not finished
    synchronizing. For more information, see
    https://bugs.launchpad.net/openstack-ansible/+bug/1543146. This is
    addressed by adding pre and post hooks into lsyncd to connect to
    the slave repo servers and disable NGINX for the duration for the
    sync.

security:
  - A sudoers entry is added to the repo_servers to allow the nginx
    user to stop and start NGINX from the init script. This ensures
    that the repo sync process can shut off NGINX while synchronizing
    data from master to slaves.
