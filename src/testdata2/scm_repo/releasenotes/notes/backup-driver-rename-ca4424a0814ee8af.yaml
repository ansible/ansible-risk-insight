    In Stein, Cinder stopped supporting configuring backup drivers without
    the full class path.  This means that you must now use the following
    values for ``cinder_service_backup_driver``.

    * ``cinder.backup.drivers.swift.SwiftBackupDriver``
    * ``cinder.backup.drivers.ceph.CephBackupDriver``

    If you do not make this change, the Cinder backup service will refuse
    to start properly.
