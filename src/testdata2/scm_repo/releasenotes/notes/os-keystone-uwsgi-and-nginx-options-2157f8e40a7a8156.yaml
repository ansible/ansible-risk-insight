features:
  - Introduced option to deploy Keystone under Uwsgi. A new variable
    ``keystone_mod_wsgi_enabled`` is introduced to toggle this
    behavior. The default is ``true`` which continues to deploy with
    mod_wsgi for Apache. The ports used by Uwsgi for socket and http
    connection for both public and admin Keystone services are
    configurable (see also the ``keystone_uwsgi_ports`` dictionary
    variable). Other Uwsgi configuration can be overridden by using
    the ``keystone_uwsgi_ini_overrides`` variable as documented
    under "Overriding OpenStack configuration defaults" in the
    OpenStack-Ansible Install Guide. Federation features should be
    considered _experimental_ with this configuration at this time.
  - Introduced option to deploy Keystone behind Nginx. A new
    variable ``keystone_apache_enabled`` is introduced to toggle
    this behavior.  The default is ``true`` which continues to
    deploy with Apache. Additional configuration can be delivered to
    Nginx through the use of the ``keystone_nginx_extra_conf`` list
    variable. Federation features are not supported with this
    configuration at this time. Use of this option requires
    ``keystone_mod_wsgi_enabled`` to be set to ``false`` which will
    deploy Keystone under Uwsgi.
