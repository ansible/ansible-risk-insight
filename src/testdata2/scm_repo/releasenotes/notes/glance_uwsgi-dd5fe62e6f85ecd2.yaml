  - The ``glance-api`` service has moved to run as a
    uWSGI application. You can set the max number of WSGI
    processes, the number of processes, threads, and
    buffer size utilizing the
    ``glance_wsgi_processes_max``,
    ``glance_wsgi_processes``, ``glance_wsgi_threads``,
    and ``glance_wsgi_buffer_size``.
    Additionally, you can override any settings in the
    uWSGI ini configuration file using the
    ``glance_api_uwsgi_ini_overrides`` setting.
