    The ``os-cinder-install.yml`` playbook will now execute a rolling
    upgrade of cinder including database migrations (both schema and
    online) as per the procedure described in the
    `cinder documentation <https://docs.openstack.org/developer/cinder/upgrade.html>`_.
    When haproxy is used as the load balancer, the backend being
    changed will be drained before changes are made, then added back
    to the pool once the changes are complete.
