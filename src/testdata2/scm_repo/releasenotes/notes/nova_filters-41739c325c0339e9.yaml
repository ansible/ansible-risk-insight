features:
  - |
    Added variable `nova_scheduler_extra_filters` which allows to extend
    list of defaulted `nova_scheduler_default_filters`
upgrade:
  - |
    String value of `nova_scheduler_default_filters` is converted to the list
    At the moment there is compatability for overriden values, that are string,
    but this support will be removed in the future releases. So deployers are
    recommended to replace their string overrides with list ones.
