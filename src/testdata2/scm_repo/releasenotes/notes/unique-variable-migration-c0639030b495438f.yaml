    All variables in the security role are now prepended with ``security_`` to
    avoid collisions with variables in other roles. All deployers who have
    used the security role in previous releases will need to prepend all
    security role variables with ``security_``.

    For example, a deployer could have disabled direct root ssh logins with the
    following variable:

    .. code-block:: yaml

       ssh_permit_root_login: yes

    That variable would become:

    .. code-block:: yaml

       security_ssh_permit_root_login: yes
