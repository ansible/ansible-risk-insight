features:
  - Two new variables (`rabbitmq_async_threads` and `rabbitmq_process_limit`)
    have been added to the openstack-ansible-rabbitmq_server role.
    The variable `rabbitmq_async_threads` limits the number of asynchronous
    threads for file and socket I/O.
    The variable `rabbitmq_process_limit` limits the overall number of supported
    processes inside the erlang VM.

upgrade:
  - The number of erlang asynchronous threads used by RabbitMQ have been
    increased from the default of 32 to 128 in order to speed up message
    processing.
  - The maximum erlang process limit for RabbitMQ has been set to 1048576
    in order to prevent virtual machine lockups which are caused when
    this limit has been reached.
