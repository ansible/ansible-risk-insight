features:
  - |
    Openstack services and infrastructure such as galera, rabbitmq
    and memcached already have defaults in their ansible roles to control the
    IP address which those services bind to. Prior to this release the default
    of 0.0.0.0 was used. A global setting in the openstack-ansible group
    variables now overrides those default bind address to be the local address
    on the openstack management network (typically br-mgmt) for the relevant
    host or container.
upgrade:
  - |
    The default bind address for all openstack services and infrastructure
    services such as galera, rabbitmq and memcached has changed from 0.0.0.0
    to the IP address of the openstack mangement network on the relevent host
    or container. Deployers should ensure that any additional systems that
    expect to communicate with internal components of their openstack-ansible
    deployment do so over the managment network. Services which are bound to
    the management network IP will not be accessible via other interfaces.
