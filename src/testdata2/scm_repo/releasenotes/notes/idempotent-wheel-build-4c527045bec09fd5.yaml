upgrade:
  - The entire repo build process is now idempotent. From now on when
    the repo build is re-run, it will only fetch updated git
    repositories and rebuild the wheels/venvs if the requirements
    have changed, or a new release is being deployed.
  - The git clone part of the repo build process now only happens when
    the requirements change. A git reclone can be forced by using the
    boolean variable ``repo_build_git_reclone``.
  - The python wheel build process now only happens when requirements
    change. A wheel rebuild may be forced by using the boolean variable
    ``repo_build_wheel_rebuild``.
  - The python venv build process now only happens when requirements
    change. A venv rebuild may be forced by using the boolean variable
    ``repo_build_venv_rebuild``.
  - The repo build process now only has the following tags, providing
    a clear path for each deliverable. The tag ``repo-build-install``
    completes the installation of required packages. The tag
    ``repo-build-wheels`` completes the wheel build process. The tag
    ``repo-build-venvs`` completes the venv build process. Finally, the
    tag ``repo-build-index`` completes the manifest preparation and
    indexing of the os-releases and links folders.
