features:
  - |
    The ``tempest_images`` data structure for the ``os_tempest`` role
    now expects the values for each image to include ``name`` (optionally)
    and ``format`` (the disk format). Also, the optional variable ``checksum``
    may be used to set the checksum expected for the file in the format
    ``<algorithm>:<checksum>``.
  - |
    The default location for the image downloads in the ``os_tempest``
    role set by the ``tempest_image_dir`` variable has now been changed
    to be ``/opt/cache/files`` in order to match the default location
    in nodepool. This improves the reliability of CI testing in
    OpenStack CI as it will find the file already cached there.
  - |
    A new variable has been introduced into the ``os_tempest`` role
    named ``tempest_image_downloader``. When set to ``deployment-host``
    (which is the default) it uses the deployment host to handle the
    download of images to be used for tempest testing. The images are
    then uploaded to the target host for uploading into Glance.
deprecations:
  - |
    The following variables have been removed from the ``os_tempest``
    role to simplify it. They have been replaced through the use of
    the data structure ``tempest_images`` which now has equivalent
    variables per image.
    - cirros_version
    - tempest_img_url
    - tempest_image_file
    - tempest_img_disk_format
    - tempest_img_name
    - tempest_images.sha256 (replaced by checksum)
fixes:
  - |
    The ``os_tempest`` tempest role was downloading images twice - once
    arbitrarily, and once to use for testing. This has been consolidated
    into a single download to a consistent location.
