features:
  - Horizon now has the ability to set arbitrary configuration options using
    global option ``horizon_config_overrides`` in YAML format. The overrides
    follow the same pattern found within the other OpenStack service
    overrides. `General documentation on overrides can be found here <https://docs.openstack.org/project-deploy-guide/openstack-ansible/latest/app-advanced-config-override.html>`_.
