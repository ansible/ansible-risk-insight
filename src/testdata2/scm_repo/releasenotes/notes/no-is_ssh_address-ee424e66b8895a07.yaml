upgrade:
  - The key **is_ssh_address** has been removed from the
    `openstack_user_config.yml` and the dynamic inventory. This key was
    responsible mapping an address to the container which was used for SSH
    connectivity. Because we've created the SSH connectivity plugin, which
    allows us the ability to connect to remote containers without SSH, this
    option is no longer useful. To keep the `openstack_user_config.yml` clean
    deployers can remove the option however moving forward it no longer has any
    effect.
