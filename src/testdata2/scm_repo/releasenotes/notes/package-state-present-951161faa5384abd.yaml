upgrade:
  - The security role will accept the currently installed version of a package
    rather than attempting to update it. This reduces unexpected changes on
    the system from subsequent runs of the security role. Deployers can still
    set ``security_package_state`` to ``latest`` to ensure that all packages
    installed by the security role are up to date.
