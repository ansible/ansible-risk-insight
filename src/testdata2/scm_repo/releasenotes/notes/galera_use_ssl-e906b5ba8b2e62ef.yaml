    MariaDB now uses TLS encryption by default. Certificate will be issued
    and signed with internal CA using PKI role.
    Deployers can disable encrypting MariaDB connections by setting
    ``galera_use_ssl: false`` in their user_variables.yml
    Client certificates could be still provided and they will be distributed
    with PKI role as well.
