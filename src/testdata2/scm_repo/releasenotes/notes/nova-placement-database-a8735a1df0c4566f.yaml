deprecations:
  - |
    The nova_placement database which was implemented in the ocata release of
    OpenStack-Ansible was never actually used for anything due to reverts in
    the upstream code. The database should be empty and can be deleted. With
    this the following variables also no longer have any function and have
    been removed.

    * ``nova_placement_galera_user``
    * ``nova_placement_galera_database``
    * ``nova_placement_db_max_overflow``
    * ``nova_placement_db_max_pool_size``
    * ``nova_placement_db_pool_timeout``
