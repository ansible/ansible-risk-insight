features:
  - |
    The galera_server role now includes the functionality from the
    galera_client role, and can optionally install the client and server
    components. This is controlled using two booleans, galera_install_server
    and galera_install_client, both of which default to false.
upgrade:
  - |
    The galera_server role now includes the functionality from the
    galera_client role, and as a result a number of the variables from
    the galera_client defaults are now available to override in the
    galera_server role defaults. In addition, a number of default variables
    have been generalised, removing the specific `_client_` or `_server_`
    parts of the names. Users of this role should check that any overrides
    they are using have the correct variables names for the new combined
    role.
