features:
  - The repo build process now selectively builds venvs based on
    whether each OpenStack service group has any hosts in it. If
    there are no hosts in the group, the venv will not be built.
    This behaviour can be optionally changed to force all venvs
    to be built by setting ``repo_build_venv_selective`` to
    ``yes``.
