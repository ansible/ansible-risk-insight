fixes:
  - Systems using systemd (like Ubuntu Xenial) were
    incorrectly limited to a low amount of open files.
    This was causing issues when restarting galera.
    A deployer can still define the maximum number
    of open files with the variable
    ``galera_file_limits`` (Defaults to 65536).
