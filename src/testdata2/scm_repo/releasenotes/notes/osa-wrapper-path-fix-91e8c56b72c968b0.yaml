    In https://review.openstack.org/582633 an adjustment was made to the
    ``openstack-ansible`` wrapper which mistakenly changed the intended
    behaviour. The wrapper is only meant to include the extra-vars and
    invoke the inventory if ``ansible-playbook`` was executed from inside
    the ``openstack-ansible`` repository clone (typically
    ``/opt/openstack-ansible``), but the change made the path irrelevant.
    This has now been fixed - ``ansible-playbook`` and ``ansible`` will
    only invoke the inventory and include extra vars if it is invoked
    from inside the git clone path.
