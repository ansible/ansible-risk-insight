upgrade:
  - The git source for python2_lxc was used in the past as the package was not
    available on pypi. Now that the package
    `has been published <https://pypi.org/project/lxc-python2>`_ the
    `py_from_git` role dependency has been removed from the `lxc_hosts`
    playbook, the role has been removed from the required roles list and the
    repo details have been removed from the repo_packages files as none of
    these details are required any more.
