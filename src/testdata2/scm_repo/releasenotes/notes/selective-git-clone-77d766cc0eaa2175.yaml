features:
  - The repo build process now selectively clones git repositories
    based on whether each OpenStack service group has any hosts in
    it. If there are no hosts in the group, the git repo for the
    service will not be cloned. This behaviour can be optionally
    changed to force all git repositories to be cloned by setting
    ``repo_build_git_selective`` to ``no``.
