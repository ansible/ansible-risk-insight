    CentOS deployments require a special COPR repository for modern LXC
    packages. The COPR repository is not mirrored at this time and this causes
    failed gate tests and production deployments.

    The role now syncs the LXC packages down from COPR to each host and builds
    a local LXC package repository in `/opt/thm-lxc2.0`. This greatly reduces
    the amount of times that packages must be downloaded from the COPR server
    during deployments, which will reduce failures until the packages can be
    hosted with a more reliable source.

    In addition, this should speed up playbook runs since ``yum`` can check a
    locally-hosted repository instead of a remote repository with availability
    and performance challenges.
