fixes:
  - When a task fails while executing a playbook, the default behaviour for
    Ansible is to fail for that host without executing any notifiers. This can
    result in configuration changes being executed, but services not being
    restarted. OpenStack-Ansible now sets ``ANSIBLE_FORCE_HANDLERS`` to
    ``True`` by default to ensure that all notified handlers attempt to
    execute before stopping the playbook execution.
