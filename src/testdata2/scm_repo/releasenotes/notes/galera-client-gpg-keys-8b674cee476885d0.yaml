upgrade:
  - |
    The data structure for ``galera_client_gpg_keys`` has been changed to be
    a dict passed directly to the applicable apt_key/rpm_key module. As such
    any overrides would need to be reviewed to ensure that they do not pass
    any key/value pairs which would cause the module to fail.
  - |
    The default values for ``galera_client_gpg_keys`` have been changed for
    all supported platforms will use vendored keys. This means that the task
    execution will no longer reach out to the internet to add the keys,
    making offline or proxy-based installations easier and more reliable.
