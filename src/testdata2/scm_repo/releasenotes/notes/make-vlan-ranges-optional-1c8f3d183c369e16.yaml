    When defining provider networks, vlan ranges are no longer required.
    When a vlan range is not specified, the provider label ``net_name``
    still be set in ``network_vlan_ranges``, but automatic VLAN
    allocation will not be available.

    Implementation Example:

    .. code-block:: text

       host_bind_override: "bond1"
       type: "vlan"
       net_name: "physnet1"
       group_binds:
       - neutron_linuxbridge_agent
