issues:
  - Paramiko version 2.0 Python requires the Python cryptography library. New system packages must
    be installed for this library. For OpenStack-Ansible versions <12.0.12, <11.2.15, <13.0.2 the
    system packages must be installed on the **deployment host** manually by executing
    ``apt-get install -y build-essential libssl-dev libffi-dev``.
