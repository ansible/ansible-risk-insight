    The security role previously set the permissions on all audit log files in
    ``/var/log/audit`` to ``0400``, but this prevents the audit daemon from
    writing to the active log file. This will prevent ``auditd`` from
    starting or restarting cleanly.

    The task now removes any permissions that are not allowed by the STIG. Any
    log files that meet or exceed the STIG requirements will not be modified.
