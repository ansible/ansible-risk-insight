features:
  - |
    The tasks within the ansible-hardening role are now based on Version 1,
    Release 3 of the Red Hat Enteprise Linux Security Technical Implementation
    Guide.
  - |
    The ``sysctl`` parameter ``kernel.randomize_va_space`` is now set to
    ``2`` by default. This matches the default of most modern Linux
    distributions and it ensures that Address Space Layout Randomization
    (ASLR) is enabled.

    The Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP) kernel module is now
    disabled by default, but a reboot is required to make the change
    effective.
