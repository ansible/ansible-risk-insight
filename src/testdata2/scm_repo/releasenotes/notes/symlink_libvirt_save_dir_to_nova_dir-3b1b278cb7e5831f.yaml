fixes:
  - The ``/var/lib/libvirt/qemu/save`` directory is now a
    symlink to ``{{ nova_system_home_folder }}/save`` to
    resolve an issue where the default location used by the
    libvirt managed save command can result with the root
    partitions on compute nodes becoming full when
    ``nova image-create`` is run on large instances.
