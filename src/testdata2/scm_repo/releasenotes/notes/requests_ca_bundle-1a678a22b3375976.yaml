features:
  - |
    New variable ``openstack_ca_bundle_path`` has been added which defines
    the path to the ca-bundle certificate which contains all system-trusted CA
    and will be used by the Python Requests module.
  - |
    Added variable ``openstack_systemd_global_overrides`` that defines
    some defaults for all systemd services. It will be deployed to all hosts
    and containers, but can be controlled with group_vars or host_vars as well
    if needed.
deprecations:
  - |
    Since certificates and CA distribution are now handled with PKI role,
    variable ``openstack_host_ca_location`` has been deprecated and removed.
