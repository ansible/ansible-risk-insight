    Each openstack service role has a new variable <role>_bind_address which
    defaults to 0.0.0.0. A global override openstack_service_bind_address may
    be used by a deployer either in group_vars or user_variables to define an
    alternative IP address for services to bind to. This feature allows a
    deployer to bind all of the services to a specific network, for example
    the openstack management network. In this release the default binding
    remains 0.0.0.0, and future releases may default the binding to the
    management network.
