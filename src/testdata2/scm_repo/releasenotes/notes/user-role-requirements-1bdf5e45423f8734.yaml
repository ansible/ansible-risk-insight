    A new optional file /etc/openstack_deploy/user-role-requirements.yml is
    now available for a deployer to override individual entries in the upstream
    ansible-role-requirements file. This can be used to point to alternative repos
    containing local fixes, or to add supplementary ansible roles that are not
    specified in the standard ansible-role-requirements.
