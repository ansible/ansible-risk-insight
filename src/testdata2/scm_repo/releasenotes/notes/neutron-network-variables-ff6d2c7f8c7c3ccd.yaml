features:
  - Deployers can now configure tempest public and private networks by setting
    the following variables, 'tempest_private_net_provider_type' to either vxlan
    or vlan and 'tempest_public_net_provider_type' to flat or vlan. Depending on
    what the deployer sets these variables to, they may also need to update other
    variables accordingly, this mainly involves 'tempest_public_net_physical_type'
    and 'tempest_public_net_seg_id'. Please refer to
    http://docs.openstack.org/mitaka/networking-guide/intro-basic-networking.html
    for more neutron networking information.
