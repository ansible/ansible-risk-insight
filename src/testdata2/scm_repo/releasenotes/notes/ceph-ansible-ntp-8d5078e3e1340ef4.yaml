upgrade:
  - |
    Users should purge the 'ntp' package from their hosts if ceph-ansible is
    enabled. ceph-ansible previously was configured to install ntp by default
    which conflicts with the OSA ansible-hardening role chrony service.
fixes:
  - |
    ceph-ansible is no longer configured to install ntp by default, which
    creates a conflict with OSA's ansible-hardening role that is used to
    implement ntp using 'chrony'.
