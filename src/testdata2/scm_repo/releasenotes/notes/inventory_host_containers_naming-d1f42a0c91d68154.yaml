fixes:
  - Changed the way we name host containers groups in
    dynamic_inventory.py for a hostname from
    hostname_containers to hostname-host_containers to
    prevent failing in the case where containers groups
    have the same name as host containers when choosing
    hostnames inspired from containers group names. This
    change fixes the following bugs
    https://bugs.launchpad.net/openstack-ansible/+bug/1512883 and
    https://bugs.launchpad.net/openstack-ansible/+bug/1528953.
