features:
  - The ceilometer configuration files other than
    ``ceilometer.conf`` are now retrieved from upstream.
    You can override the repository from which these are
    retrieved by setting the
   ``ceilometer_git_config_lookup_location`` variable
    which defaults to the git.openstack.org.
deprecations:
  - The vars to set ``source_sample_interval`` for the
    ``os_ceilometer`` role are deprecated and will be
    removed in the Queen cycle. To override these variables
    after Queen, utilize the
    ``ceilometer_pipeline_yaml_overrides`` file.
