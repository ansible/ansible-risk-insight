deprecations:
  - The option ``cache_prep_commands`` from ``lxc_cache_map`` has been
    removed. This option has been converted to a template file within
    the **lxc_hosts** role. In order to set specific cache commands within
    the template it is recommended that deployers set
    ``lxc_cache_prep_pre_commands`` or ``lxc_cache_prep_post_commands``. If the
    entire prep script needs to be overridden deployers can set
    ``lxc_cache_prep_template`` to the full local path of the prep template and
    the role will use this script irrespective of the base container type.
