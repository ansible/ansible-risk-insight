    The following security headers were added to the haproxy Horizon service:
    `strict-transport-security`, `x-content-type-options`, `referrer-policy`
    and `content-security-policy`.
    Care should be taken when deploying the `strict-transport-security` header,
    as this header implements Trust on First Use security, meaning that
    after a browser first visits the page the browser will enforce the use of
    HTTPS until the max age time has expired.
    For the time being the `strict-transport-security` `preload` token which
    indicates that you are happy to have your site included in the HSTS preload
    list that is built into browsers has been excluded.
    The headers can be disabled by setting `haproxy_security_headers: []` and
    the CSP (Content Security Policy) for Horizon can be overridden to support
    things like federated login by setting `haproxy_horizon_csp`.
    There is the option to extend to all haproxy services in the future, but as
    the headers are only used by browsers there maybe limited benefit to doing
    this other than for keystone and console services.
