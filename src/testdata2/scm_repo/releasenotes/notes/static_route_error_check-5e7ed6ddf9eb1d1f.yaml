fixes:
  - Static route information for provider networks now *must* include the
    `cidr` and `gateway` information. If either key is missing, an error will
    be raised and the dynamic_inventory.py script will halt before any Ansible
    action is taken. Previously, if either key was missing, the inventory
    script would continue silently without adding the static route
    information to the networks.

    Note that this check does not validate the CIDR or gateway values, just
    just that the values are present.
