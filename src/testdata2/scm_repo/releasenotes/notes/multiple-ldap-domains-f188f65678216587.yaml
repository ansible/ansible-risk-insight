features:
 - Keystone can now be configured for multiple LDAP or Active Directory
   identity back-ends. Configuration of this feature is documented in the
   `Keystone Configuration <http://docs.openstack.org/developer/openstack-ansible/install-guide/configure-keystone.html>`_
   section of the `Install Guide <http://docs.openstack.org/developer/openstack-ansible/install-guide/>`_.
upgrade:
 - The first tier of the ``keystone_ldap`` dictionary variable now relates to
   the Keystone Domain name. An existing ``keystone_ldap`` configuration entry
   can be converted by renaming the ``ldap`` key to the domain name 'Default'.
   **Note** that the domain name entry is case-sensitive.
 - The ``keystone_ldap_identity_driver`` variable has been removed. The driver
   for an LDAP back-end in Keystone now simply uses the value 'ldap'. There
   are no other back-end options for Keystone at this time.
