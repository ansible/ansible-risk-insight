    From now on, a deployer can override any group_var in userspace, by
    creating a folder ``/etc/openstack_deploy/group_vars/``. This folder
    has precedence over OpenStack-Ansible default group_vars, and the
    merge behavior is similar to Ansible merge behavior.
    The group_vars folder precedence can still be changed with the
    GROUP_VARS_PATH. Same applies for host vars.
