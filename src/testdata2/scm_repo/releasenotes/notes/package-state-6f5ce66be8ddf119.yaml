features:
  - A new global option to control all package install states has been
    implemented. The default action for all distribution package
    installations is to ensure that the latest package is installed.
    This may be changed to only verify if the package is present by
    setting ``package_state`` to ``present``.
upgrade:
  - All roles always checks whether the latest package is installed
    when executed. If a deployer wishes to change the check to
    only validate the presence of the package, the option
    ``package_state`` should be set to ``present``.
