    A new variable `openstack_hosts_apt_pinned_packages` is added which allows
    deployment wide apt pins to be defined in user_variables. The variable defaults
    to pinning the UCA repository to a priority lower than the Ubuntu repositories for
    any binary packages generated from the ceph source package. The intention is to
    ensure that Ceph packages are always installed from the Ubuntu repositories, or
    alternatively the official ceph repositories if the ceph_client role is run later
    against a host. The ceph packages for a particular openstack release may not be the
    same version as those expected by the rest of openstack-ansible so this change ensures
    consistency in the deployed ceph version.

    The new variable `openstack_hosts_apt_pinned_packages` is added to the openstack_hosts
    ansible role and sets the value of `apt_pinned_packages` for the apt_package_pinning
    role run as a dependancy of the openstack_hosts role. Existing use of the
    `apt_pinned_packages` variable by deployers in user_variables should be reviewed
    to ensure that those  pins are applied by the intended ansible roles, and swapped
    to this new variable if necessary.
