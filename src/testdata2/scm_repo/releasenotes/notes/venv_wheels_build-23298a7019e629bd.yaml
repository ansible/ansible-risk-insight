    Functionality of ``venv_rebuild`` has been adjusted to the correct scope.
    Now setting this variable to true will not trigger wheels rebuild -
    it will just remove and re-create your virtualenv.
    If you want to rebuild wheels, a new variable ``venv_wheels_rebuild`` has
    been implemented.
