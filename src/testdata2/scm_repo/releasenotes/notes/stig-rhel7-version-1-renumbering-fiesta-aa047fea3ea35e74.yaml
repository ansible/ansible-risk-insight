    The first release of the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 STIG was entirely
    renumbered from the pre-release versions. Many of the STIG configurations
    simply changed numbers, but some were removed or changed. A few new
    configurations were added as well.
security:
  - |
    The latest version of the RHEL 7 STIG requires that a standard login banner
    is presented to users when they log into the system (V-71863). The
    security role now deploys a login banner that is used for console and ssh
    sessions.
  - |
    The ``cn_map`` permissions and ownership adjustments included as part of
    RHEL-07-040070 and RHEL-07-040080 has been removed. This STIG
    configuration was removed in the most recent release of the RHEL 7 STIG.
  - |
    The PKI-based authentication checks for RHEL-07-040030, RHEL-07-040040,
    and RHEL-07-040050 are no longer included in the RHEL 7 STIG. The tasks
    and documentation for these outdated configurations are removed.
