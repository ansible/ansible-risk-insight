    Enable VeNCrypt authentication scheme from noVNC proxy to compute nodes.
    When using HTTPS, the TLS encryption only applies to data between the
    tenant user and proxy server. To provide protection from the noVNC proxy
    to the Compute Nodes, it is necessary to enable the VeNCrypt
    authentication scheme for VNC.

    A pre-existing PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) setup is
    required.

    Initially to help with the transition from unencrypted VNC to
    VeNCrypt, compute nodes auth scheme allows for both encrypted and
    unencrypted sessions using the variable `nova_vencrypt_auth_scheme`,
    this will be removed in future releases.
