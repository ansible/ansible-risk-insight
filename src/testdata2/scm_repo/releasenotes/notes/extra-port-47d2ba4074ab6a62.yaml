    Galera will now additionally listen on port 3307 by default, with this port
    being used by the monitoring user to check cluster status. Ensure that any
    firewall rules permit access to this port before upgrading. If an
    'extra_port' was already configured, ensure that any conflicting
    configuration is removed and set your preferred values via
    'galera_monitoring_port' and 'galera_monitoring_max_connections'.
