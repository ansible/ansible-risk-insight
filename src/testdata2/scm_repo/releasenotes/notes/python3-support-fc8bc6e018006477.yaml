    Deployments will now default to using python3 when a python3 interpreter
    is present in the operating system. Each openstack-ansible role has a new
    variable for the form <role>_venv_python_executable which defaults to python2
    but a global variable openstack_venv_python_executable in the openstack-ansible
    group variables sets this to python3 on supporting operating systems. This
    enables a deployer is to selectively use python2 or python3 on a per service
    basis if required. The ansible-runtime venv is also created using python3 on
    the deploy host if possible.

    New virtual environments will be created using python3, giving
    a straightforward transition from python2 to python3 during the major upgrade.
    The ansible-runtime virtual environment on the deployment host will also
    be upgraded from python2 to python3 where the operating system allows.
