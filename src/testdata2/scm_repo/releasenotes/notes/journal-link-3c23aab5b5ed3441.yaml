features:
  - In a greenfield deployment containers will now bind link
    their journals to the physical host machine in the
    ``/var/log/journal/{{ machine_id }}`` location. During an
    upgrade this change will be added to the container config but
    will not go into effect until the container is restarted.
    Because the restart is not forced the operator can perform
    restarts to best suit the needs of their environment.
    Journal linking provides operators the ability to log stream
    and health check containerized systems without having to
    attach or otherwise login. If this feature is not needed or
    desired it can be disabled by setting the option
    ``lxc_container_journal_link`` to *false*.
