    memcached now logs with multiple levels of verbosity, depending on
    the user variables. Setting ``debug: True`` enables maximum verbosity while
    setting ``verbose: True`` logs with an intermediate level.

upgrade:
  - The memcached log is removed from /var/log/memcached.log and is now
    stored in the /var/log/memcached folder.
