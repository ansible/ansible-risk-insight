features:
  - The galera cluster now supports cluster health checks over HTTP using port
    9200. The new cluster check ensures a node is healthy by running a simple
    query against the wsrep sync status using monitoring user. This change will
    provide for a more robust cluster check ensuring we have the most fault
    tolerant galera cluster possible.
