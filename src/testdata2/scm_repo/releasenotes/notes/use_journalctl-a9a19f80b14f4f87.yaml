features:
  - |
    All roles are migrated from usage of regular log files to systemd-journald
deprecations:
  - |
    Due to usage of systemd-journald mapping of /openstack/log/ to
    /var/log/$SERVICE is not present anymore. Also rsyslog_client role is not
    called for projects since logs are stored in journald.
    Also variables like service_log_dir are not supported anymore and have no
    effect.
