upgrade:
  - The gnocchi_archive_policies and
    gnocchi_archive_policy_rules variables never had full
    support in the role so were ineffective at the intended
    purpose. The task references to them have been removed
    and the library to perform gnocchi operations has also
    been removed. This eliminates the need for the gnocchi
    client to be installed outside the virtual environment
    as well.
