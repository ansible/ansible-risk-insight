features:
  - A new variable has been added to allow a deployer to control
    the restart of containers from common-tasks/os-lxc-container-setup.yml.
    This new option is ``lxc_container_allow_restarts`` and has a
    default of ``true``. If a deployer wishes to disable the
    auto-restart functionality they can set this value to ``false``
    and automatic container restarts will be disabled.

    This is a complement to the same option already present in the
    lxc_container_create role.

    This option is useful to avoid uncoordinated restarts of galera
    or rabbitmq containers if the LXC container configuration changes
    in a way that requires a restart.
