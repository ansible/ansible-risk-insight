features:
  - Removed dependency for ``cinder_backends_rbd_inuse`` in nova.conf
    when setting ``rbd_user`` and ``rbd_secret_uuid`` variables.
    Cinder delivers all necessary values via RPC when attaching the
    volume, so those variables are only necessary for ephemeral
    disks stored in Ceph. These variables are required to be set up
    on cinder-volume side under backend section.
