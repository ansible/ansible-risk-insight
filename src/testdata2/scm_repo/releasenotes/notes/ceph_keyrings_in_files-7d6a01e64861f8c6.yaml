    Get ceph keyrings from files, if variable``ceph_keyrings_dir`` is defined
    the keyrings will be extracted from files. All files in the directory
    must have ``.keyring`` extention and be named with its corresponding
    ``ceph_client`` name. For example, if ``cinder_ceph_client`` is ``cinder``
    the cinder keyring file must be named ``cinder.keyring``.
    Each file must contain username and the key and nothing more, below
    an example for cinder.keyring content.
