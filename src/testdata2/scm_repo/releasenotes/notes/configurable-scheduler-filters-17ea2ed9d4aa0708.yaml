    The list of enabled filters for the Cinder scheduler,
    `scheduler_default_filters` in `cinder.conf`, could previously be
    defined only via an entry in ``cinder_cinder_conf_overrides``. You now
    have the option to instead define a list variable,
    ``cinder_scheduler_default_filters``, that defines the enabled
    filters. This is helpful if you either want to disable one of the
    filters enabled by default (at the time of writing, these are
    `AvailabilityZoneFilter`, `CapacityFilter`, and
    `CapabilitiesFilter`), or if conversely you want to add a filter
    that is normally not enabled, such as `DifferentBackendFilter` or
    `InstanceLocalityFilter`.

    For example, to enable the `InstanceLocalityFilter` in addition to
    the normally enabled scheduler filters, use the following variable.

    .. code-block:: yaml

      cinder_scheduler_default_filters:
        - AvailabilityZoneFilter
        - CapacityFilter
        - CapabilitiesFilter
        - InstanceLocalityFilter
