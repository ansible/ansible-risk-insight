fixes:
  - Setting the haproxy_bind list on a service is now used as an override to the
    other VIPs defined in the environment. Previously it was being treated as
    an append to the other VIPs so there was no path to override the VIP binds
    for a service. For example, haproxy_bind could be used to bind a service to
    the internal VIP only.
