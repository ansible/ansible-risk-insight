    Newer releases of CentOS ship a version of libnss that depends on the existence
    of /dev/random and /dev/urandom in the operating system in order to run.  This
    causes a problem during the cache preparation process which runs inside chroot
    that does not contain this, resulting in errors with the following message.

    .. code-block:: text

      error: Failed to initialize NSS library

    This has been resolved by introducing a /dev/random and /dev/urandom inside
    the chroot-ed environment.
