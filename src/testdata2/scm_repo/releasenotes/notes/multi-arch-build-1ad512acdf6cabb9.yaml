features:
  - The repo build process is now able to support building and synchronizing
    artifacts for multiple CPU architectures. Build artifacts are now tagged
    with the appropriate CPU architecture by default, and synchronization of
    build artifacts from secondary, architecture-specific repo servers back
    to the primary repo server is supported.
