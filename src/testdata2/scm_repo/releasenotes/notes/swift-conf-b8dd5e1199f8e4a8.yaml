fixes:
  - Previously, the ``ansible_managed`` var was being
    used to insert a header into the ``swift.conf`` that
    contained date/time information. This meant that
    swift.conf across different nodes did not have the
    same MD5SUM, causing ``swift-recon --md5`` to break.
    We now insert a piece of static text instead to
    resolve this issue.
