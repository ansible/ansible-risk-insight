upgrade:
  - The ``pip_get_pip_options`` override has been removed from group_vars,
    resulting in the empty default being used. Previously this method was
    used to lock the pip install source appropriately, but this has been
    handled through the pip_lock_down role for several cycles. If a deployer
    has implemented an override in user_variables based on the previous
    group_vars settings then the settings should be reviewed. This override
    may now be used for catering to situations where the pip installation
    requires extra options set to allow installing through a proxy, or
    disabling certificate validation.
