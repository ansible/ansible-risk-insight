features:
  - |
    The mechanism used previously to syncronise repo server contents between
    highly available sets of repo servers in a multinode deployment (lsyncd
    and rsync over ssh) is removed and replaced with a shared filesystem
    mount. This permits much easier support for multi operating system and
    multi processor architectures in the deployment when building and serving
    python wheels using the repo server. The default deployment will run a
    glusterfs server in each repo server host, and mount the glusterfs
    fileystem at /var/www/repo using the system_mount ansible role. If a
    deployment wishes to use an alternative external shared filesystem, the
    new variable `openstack_repo_server_enable_glusterfs` can be set to `false`
    and alternative mounts created by overriding the new `repo_server_systemd_mounts`
    variable. It is mandatory to use some type of shared filesystem for the
    repo server in all deployments.
upgrade:
  - |
    The repo server hosts will stop and uninstall existing lsyncd and rsync
    services from the repo server hosts. This functionality will be replaced
    by default with a glusterfs shared filesystem. If a deployment uses a
    firewall on the control plane, the rules should be updated to allow the
    glusterfs traffic between the repo server hosts. Alternative external shared
    filesystems (eg NFS, cephfs, others) may be used if required and the new
    variables `repo_server_systemd_mounts` and `openstack_repo_server_enable_glusterfs`
    allow a deployment to override the default use of glusterfs.
