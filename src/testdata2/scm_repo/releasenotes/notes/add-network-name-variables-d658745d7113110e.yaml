fixes:
  - This role assumes that there is a network named "public|private" and a
    subnet named "public|private-subnet". These names are made configurable
    by the addition of two sets of variables; ``tempest_public_net_name``
    and ``tempest_public_subnet_name`` for public networks and 
    ``tempest_private_net_name`` and ``tempest_private_subnet_name`` for
    private networks This addresses `bug 1588818 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/openstack-ansible/+bug/1588818>`_
