    Variable ``systemd_lock_path`` has been dropped and has no effect now.
    In order to customize lock dir path please use ``systemd_lock_dir``.
    Please keep in mind, that for ``systemd_lock_dir`` you don't need to
    provide full path like it was with ``systemd_lock_path`` since service
    name is added to the end of the path.
