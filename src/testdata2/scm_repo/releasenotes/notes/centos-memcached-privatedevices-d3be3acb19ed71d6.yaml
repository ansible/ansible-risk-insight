    OpenStack-Ansible sets a new variable, `memcached_disable_privatedevices`,
    that controls whether the `PrivateDevices` configuration in MemcacheD's
    systemd unit file is enabled.

    If the `memcached_server` role is deployed on a bare metal host, the
    default is maintained (`PrivateDevices=true`). If the role is deployed
    within a container, the `PrivateDevices` configuration is set to `true`
    to work around a systemd bug with a bind mounted `/dev/ptmx`.

    See `Launchpad Bug 1697531 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/openstack-ansible/+bug/1697531>`_
    for more details.
