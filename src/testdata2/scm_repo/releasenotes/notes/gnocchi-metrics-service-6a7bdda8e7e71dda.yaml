  - Gnocchi is available for deploy as a metrics storage
    service. At this time it does not integrate with Aodh
    or Ceilometer. To deploy Aodh or Ceilometer to use
    Gnocchi as a storage / query API, each must be
    configured appropriately with the use of overrides as
    described in the configuration guides for each of
    these services.
