upgrade:
  - |
    Tacker role now uses default systemd_service role. Due to this upstart
    is not supported anymore. Was added variable tacker_init_config_overrides,
    with wich deployer may override predifined options.
    Also variable program_override has no effect now, and tacker_service_names
    was removed in favor of tacker_service_name.
