features:
  - The repo install process is now able to support building and synchronizing
    artifacts for multiple CPU architectures. To support multiple architectures,
    one or more repo servers must be created for each CPU architecture in the
    deployment. When multiple CPU architectures are detected among the repo
    servers, the repo-discovery process will automatically assign a repo
    master to perform the build process for each architecture.
