upgrade:
  - The Aodh data migration script should be run to
    migrate alarm data from MongoDB storage to Galera
    due to the pending removal of MongoDB support.
fixes:
  - Aodh has deprecated support for NoSQL storage (MongoDB
    and Cassandra) in Mitaka with removal scheduled for
    the O* release. This causes warnings in the logs. The
    default of using MongoDB storage for Aodh is replaced
    with the use of Galera. Continued use of MongoDB will
    require the use of vars to specify a correct
    ``aodh_connection_string`` and add pymongo to the
    ``aodh_pip_packages`` list.
