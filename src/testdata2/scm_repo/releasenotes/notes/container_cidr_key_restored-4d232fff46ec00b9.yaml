fixes:
  - The 'container_cidr' key has been restored back to openstack_inventory.json

    The fix to remove deleted global override keys mistakenly deleted the
    'container_cidr' key, as well. This was used by downstream consumers,
    and cannot be reconstructed with other information inside the inventory
    file. Regression tests were also added.
