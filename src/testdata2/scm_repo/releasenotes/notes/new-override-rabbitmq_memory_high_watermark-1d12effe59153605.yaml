    The override ``rabbitmq_memory_high_watermark`` can be used to set the
    maximum size of the erlang Virtual Machine before the garbage collection
    is triggered. The default is lowered to ``0.2``, from ``0.4`` as the
    garbage collection can require 2x of allocated amount during its
    operation. This can result in a equivalent use of ``0.4``, resulting in
    40% of memory usage, visible to the rabbitMQ container. The original
    default setting of ``0.4`` can lead to 80% memory allocation of rabbitMQ,
    potentially leading to a scenario where the underlying Linux kernel
    is killing the process due to shortage of virtual memory.

    The rabbitMQ high watermark is set to ``0.2`` rather than ``0.4`` to
    prevent possible OOM situations, which limits the maximum memory usage
    by rabbitMQ to 40% rather than 80% of the memory visible to the rabbitMQ
    container. The override ``rabbitmq_memory_high_watermark`` can be used
    to alter the limit.
