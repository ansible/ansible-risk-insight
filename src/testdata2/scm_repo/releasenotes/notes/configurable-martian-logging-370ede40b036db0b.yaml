    Although the STIG requires martian packets to be logged, the logging is
    now disabled by default. The logs can quickly fill up a syslog server or
    make a physical console unusable.

    Deployers that need this logging enabled will need to set the following
    Ansible variable:

    .. code-block:: yaml

       security_sysctl_enable_martian_logging: yes
