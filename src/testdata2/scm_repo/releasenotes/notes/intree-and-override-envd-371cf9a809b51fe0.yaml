features:
  - The env.d directory included with OpenStack-Ansible is now used as the
    first source for the environment skeleton, and
    ``/etc/openstack_deploy/env.d`` will be used only to override values.
    Deployers without customizations will no longer need to copy the env.d
    directory to /etc/openstack_deploy.

    As a result, the env.d copy operation has been removed from the node
    bootstrap role.
upgrade:
  - Upgrades will not replace entries in the /etc/openstack_deploy/env.d
    directory, though new versions of OpenStack-Ansible will now use the
    shipped env.d as a base, which may alter existing deployments.
