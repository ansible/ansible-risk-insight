features:
  - The ``os_neutron`` role now determines the default configuration for
    openvswitch-agent ``tunnel_types`` and the presence or absence of
    ``local_ip`` configuration based on the value of
    ``neutron_ml2_drivers_type``. Deployers may directly control this
    configuration by overriding the ``neutron_tunnel_types`` variable .
  - The ``os_neutron`` role now configures neutron ml2 to load the
    ``l2_population`` mechanism driver by default based on the value of
    ``neutron_l2_population``. Deployers may directly control the neutron ml2
    mechanism drivers list by overriding the ``mechanisms`` variable in the
    ``neutron_plugins`` dictionary.
