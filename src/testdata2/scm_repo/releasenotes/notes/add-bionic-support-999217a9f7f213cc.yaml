features:
  - Support has been added for deploying on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS hosts.
    The most significant change is a major version increment of LXC
    from 2.x to 3.x which deprecates some previously used elements
    of the container configuration file.
upgrade:
  - The supported upgrade path from Xenial to Bionic is via
    re-installation of the host OS across all nodes and redeployment
    of the required services. The Rocky branch of OSA is intended
    as the transition point for such upgrades from Xenial to Bionic.
    At this time there is no support for in-place operating system
    upgrades (typically via ``do-release-upgrade``).
