    The EPEL repository is now removed in favor of the RDO repository.

    **This is a breaking change for existing CentOS deployments.** The ``yum``
    package manager will have errors when it finds that certain packages that
    it installed from EPEL are no longer available.  Deployers may need to
    rebuild container or reinstall packages to complete this change.
