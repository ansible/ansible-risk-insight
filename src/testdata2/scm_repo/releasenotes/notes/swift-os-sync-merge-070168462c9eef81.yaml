upgrade:
  - The os_swift and os_swift_sync role have been merged into the single os_swift role. Two
    variables (``swift_do_setup`` and ``swift_do_sync``) have been implemented to action the
    install and synchronise code paths. The separate playbooks have been adjusted to make use
    of these variables to ensure that the behaviour is exactly the same as before.
