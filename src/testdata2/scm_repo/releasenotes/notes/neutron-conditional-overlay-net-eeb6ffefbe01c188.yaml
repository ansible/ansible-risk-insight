features:
  - A conditional has been added to the ``_local_ip`` settings used in
    the ``neutron_local_ip`` which removes the hard requirement for an
    overlay network to be set within a deployment. If no overlay network
    is set within the deployment the ``local_ip`` will be set to the value
    of "ansible_ssh_host".
