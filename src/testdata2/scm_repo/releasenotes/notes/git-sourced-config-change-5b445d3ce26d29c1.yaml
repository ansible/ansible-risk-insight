    In order to collect the default files used for various templates, the
    implementation has been changed from using a git source to rather
    using the built-in templates from the venv build based on the setup.cfg
    file. As such, the following variables have been removed.

    * ``keystone_git_config_lookup_location``
    * ``keystone_paste_git_file_path``
    * ``keystone_sso_callback_git_file_path``

    Instead, a location on the deployment host where the venv defaults are
    stored is now configurable using the variable
    ``keystone_config_cache_path`` which defaults to ``cache/keystone`` in
    the deploy user home directory. This location is used as a template
    source when deploying the file to the target host.
