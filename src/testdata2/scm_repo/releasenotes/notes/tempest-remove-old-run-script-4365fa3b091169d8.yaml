upgrade:
  - The ``openstack_tempest_gate.sh`` script has been removed
    as it requires the use of the ``run_tempest.sh`` script
    which has been deprecated in Tempest. In order to
    facilitate the switch, the default for the variable
    ``tempest_run`` has been set to ``yes``, forcing the role
    to execute tempest by default. This default can be changed
    by overriding the value to ``no``. The test whitelist may
    be set through the list variable ``tempest_test_whitelist``.
