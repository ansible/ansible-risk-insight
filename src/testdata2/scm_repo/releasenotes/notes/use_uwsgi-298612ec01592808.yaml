upgrade:
  - |
    Gnocchi migrated from usage of Apache mod_wsgi or native daemon to uWSGI
    daemon. This means, that some variables are not available and has no effect
    anymore, specifically
    * `gnocchi_use_mod_wsgi`
    * `gnocchi_apache_*`
    * `gnocchi_ssl*` (except `gnocchi_ssl_external` - it's still in place)
    * `gnocchi_user_ssl_*`

    During upgrade process role will drop `gnocchi_service_port` from apache
    listeners (ports.conf) and gnocchi virtualhost, which by default means
    misconfigured apache service (since it won't have any listeners) unless
    it's aio build and this apache server is in use by other role/service.
    Apache server won't be dropped from gnocchi_api hosts, so deployers
    are encoureged to remove it manually.
