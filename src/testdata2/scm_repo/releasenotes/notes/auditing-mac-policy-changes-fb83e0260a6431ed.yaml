upgrade:
  - |
    The variable ``security_audit_apparmor_changes`` is now renamed to
    ``security_audit_mac_changes`` and is enabled by default. Setting
    ``security_audit_mac_changes`` to ``no`` will disable syscall auditing for
    any changes to AppArmor policies (in Ubuntu) or SELinux policies (in
    CentOS).
features:
  - |
    The auditd rules template included a rule that audited changes to the
    AppArmor policies, but the SELinux policy changes were not being audited.
    Any changes to SELinux policies in ``/etc/selinux`` are now being logged
    by auditd.
