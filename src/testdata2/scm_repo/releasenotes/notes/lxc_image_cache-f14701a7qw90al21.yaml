features:
  - The option ``lxc_hosts_container_image_url`` has been added allowing
    deployers to define their base image url to whatever it needs to be
    removing the requirement for operators to maintain an internal LXC
    index in the event they want to host a private repository.
  - The option ``lxc_hosts_container_image_download_legacy`` has been
    added allowing a deployer to enable the use of the legacy lxc image
    repository. This option is a Boolean and has a default of **false**.
deprecations:
  - The variable ``lxc_image_cache_server_mirrors`` has been deprecated
    in the "lxc_hosts" role. This option has been replaced by the static
    variable ``lxc_hosts_container_image_url``. This variable will continue
    to function as a single element list allowing existing automation to
    function when in legacy image mode but should not be considered in use
    by default.
  - The variable ``lxc_image_cache_server`` has been deprecated in the
    ``lxc_hosts`` role. This option has been replaced by the static
    variable ``lxc_hosts_container_image_url``.
other:
  - The use of **images.linuxcontainers.org** is no longer required. While
    the images provided by that build system are perfectly functional they
    have been less than optimal in a lot ways for a very long time. The
    ``lxc_hosts`` role will now pull a base image from the upstream distro
    being deployed. If a deployer wishes to continue using the images from
    **images.linuxcontainers.org** they are welcome to but it is no longer
    forced.
