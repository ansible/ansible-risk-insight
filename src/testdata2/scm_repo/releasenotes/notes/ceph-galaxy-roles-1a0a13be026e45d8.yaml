upgrade:
  - The ceph-ansible common roles are no longer namespaced with a galaxy-style
    '.' (ie. ``ceph.ceph-common`` is now cloned as ``ceph-common``), due to a
    change in the way upstream meta dependencies are handled in the ceph roles.
    The roles will be cloned according to the new naming, and an upgrade
    playbook ``ceph-galaxy-removal.yml`` has been added to clean up the stale
    galaxy-named roles.
