deprecations:
  - |
    The repo build process no longer builds packaged venvs. Instead, the venvs
    are created on the target hosts as the install process for each service
    needs to. This opens up the opportunity for roles to be capable of creating
    multiple venvs, and for any role to create venvs - neither of these options
    were possible in previous releases.

    The following variables therefore have been removed.

    * ``repo_build_venv_selective``
    * ``repo_build_venv_rebuild``
    * ``repo_build_venv_timeout``
    * ``repo_build_concurrency``
    * ``repo_build_venv_build_dir``
    * ``repo_build_venv_dir``
    * ``repo_build_venv_pip_install_options``
    * ``repo_build_venv_command_options``
    * ``repo_venv_default_pip_packages``
