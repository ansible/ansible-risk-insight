    Variables ``gnocchi_storage_redis_url`` and ``gnocchi_incoming_redis_url``
    were added to manage redis connection if it's picked as an storage/incoming
    driver.
    Default value is redis://localhost:6379/
    Please mention, that OpenStack-Ansible does not provide isntallation of
    Redis as of today.
