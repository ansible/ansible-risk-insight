features:
  - There is a new default configuration for keepalived, supporting more than 2 nodes.
  - In order to make use of the latest stable keepalived version, the variable
    ``keepalived_use_latest_stable`` must be set to ``True``
issues:
  - In the latest stable version of keepalived there is a problem with the priority
    calculation when a deployer has more than five keepalived nodes. The problem causes the
    whole keepalived cluster to fail to work. To work around this issue it is recommended that
    deployers limit the number of keepalived nodes to no more than five or that the priority
    for each node is set as part of the configuration (cf. ``haproxy_keepalived_vars_file``
    variable).
upgrade:
  - There is a new default configuration for keepalived. When running the haproxy playbook,
    the configuration change will cause a keepalived restart unless the deployer has used a custom
    configuration file. The restart will cause the virtual IP addresses managed by keepalived to
    be briefly unconfigured, then reconfigured.
  - A new version of keepalived will be installed on the haproxy nodes if the variable
    ``keepalived_use_latest_stable`` is set to ``True`` and more than one haproxy node is
    configured. The update of the package will cause keepalived to restart and therefore will
    cause the virtual IP addresses managed by keepalived to be briefly unconfigured, then
    reconfigured.
