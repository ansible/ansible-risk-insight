issues:
  - |
    With the release of CentOS 7.5, all pike releases are broken due to a
    mismatch in version between the libvirt-python library specified by the
    OpenStack community, and the version provided in CentOS 7.5. As such OSA
    is unable build the appropriate python library for libvirt. The only
    recourse for this is to upgrade the environment to the latest queens
    release.
fixes:
  - |
    In order to prevent further issues with a libvirt and python-libvirt
    version mismatch, KVM-based compute nodes will now use the distribution
    package python library for libvirt. This should resolve the issue seen
    with pike builds on CentOS 7.5.
deprecations:
  - |
    The variable ``nova_compute_pip_packages`` is no longer used and has
    been removed.
