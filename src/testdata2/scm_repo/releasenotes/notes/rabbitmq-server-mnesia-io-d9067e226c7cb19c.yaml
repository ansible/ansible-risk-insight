    The default Mnesia ``dump_log_write_threshold`` value
    has changed to ``300`` instead of ``100`` for efficiency.
    ``dump_log_write_threshold`` specifies the maximum number of writes
    allowed to the transaction log before a new dump of the log is performed.
    Increasing this value can increase the performances
    during the queues/exchanges/bindings creation/destroying.
    The values should be between 100 and 1000. More detail [1].
