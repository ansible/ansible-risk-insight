features:
  - LBaaS v2 is available for deployment in addition to LBaaS v1. Both versions
    are mutually exclusive and cannot be running at the same time.
    Deployers will need to re-create any existing load balancers if they switch
    between LBaaS versions. Switching to LBaaS v2 will stop any existing LBaaS
    v1 load balancers.
upgrade:
  - Existing LBaaS v1 load balancers and agents will not be altered by the
    new OpenStack-Ansible release.
