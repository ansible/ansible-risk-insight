features:
  - |
    A new variable ``centos_mirror_url`` is introduced to the openstack_hosts
    role to allow a single deployment wide variable to control the location
    of the centos package mirror.
upgrade:
  - |
    Existing use of the variable ``openstack_hosts_centos_mirror_url`` will
    continue to work as in previous releases, but the new variable
    ``centos_mirror_url`` can be used to define the mirror location for the
    whole deployment.
