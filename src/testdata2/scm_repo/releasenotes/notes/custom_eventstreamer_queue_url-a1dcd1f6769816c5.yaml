    A typical OSA install will put the neutron and octavia queues on different
    vhosts thus preventing the event streamer from working While octavia is
    streaming to its own queue the consumer on the neutron side listens to the
    neutron queue. With a recent octavia enhancement a separate queue for the
    event streamer can be configured. This patch will set up the event
    streamer to post into the neutron queue using neutron's credentials. Thus
    reaching the consumer on the neutron-lbaas side and allowing for
    streaming.

    Since we use neutron's credentials to access the queue, security conscious
    people might want to set up an extra user for octavia on the neutron queue
    restricted to the topics octavia posts to.
