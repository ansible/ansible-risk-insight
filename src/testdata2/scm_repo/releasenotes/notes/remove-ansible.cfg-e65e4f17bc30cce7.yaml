features:
  - Our general config options are now stored in an
    "/usr/local/bin/openstack-ansible.rc" file and will
    be sourced when the "openstack-ansible" wrapper is
    invoked. The RC file will read in BASH environment
    variables and should any Ansible option be set that
    overlaps with our defaults the provided value will
    be used.
other:
  - The in tree "ansible.cfg" file in the playbooks
    directory has been removed. This file was making
    compatibility difficult for deployers who need to
    change these values. Additionally this files very
    existence forced Ansible to ignore any other config
    file in either a users home directory or in the
    default "/etc/ansible" directory.
