features:
  - When `venvwithindex=True` and `ignorerequirements=True` are both specified
    in `tempest_git_install_fragments` (as was previously the default), this
    results in tempest being installed from PyPI without any constraints being
    applied. This could result in the version of tempest being installed in the
    integrated build being different than the version being installed in the
    independent role tests. Going forward, we remove the `tempest_git_*`
    overrides in playbooks/defaults/repo_packages/openstack_testing.yml so that
    the integrated build installs tempest from PyPI, but with appropriate
    constraints applied.
