features:
  - Container boot ordering has been implemented on container types
    where it would be beneficial. This change ensures that stateful
    systems running within a container are started ahead of
    non-stateful systems. While this change has no impact on a running
    deployment it will assist with faster recovery should any node
    hosting container go down or simply need to be restarted.
  - A new task has been added to the "os-lxc-container-setup.yml"
    common-tasks file. This new task will allow for additional
    configurations to be added without having to restart the
    container. This change is helpful in cases where non-impacting
    config needs to be added or updated to a running containers.
