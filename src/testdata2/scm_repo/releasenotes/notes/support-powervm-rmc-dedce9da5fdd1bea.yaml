fixes:
  - Setup for the PowerVM driver was not properly configuring the system
    to support RMC configuration for client instances. This fix introduces
    an interface template for PowerVM that properly supports mixed IPV4/IPV6
    deploys and adds documentation for PowerVM RMC. For more information see
    bug 1643988.
