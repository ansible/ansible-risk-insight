    Generating and validating checksums for all files installed by packages is now
    disabled by default. The check causes delays in playbook runs and it can
    consume a significant amount of CPU and I/O resources. Deployers can re-enable
    the check by setting ``security_check_package_checksums`` to ``yes``.
