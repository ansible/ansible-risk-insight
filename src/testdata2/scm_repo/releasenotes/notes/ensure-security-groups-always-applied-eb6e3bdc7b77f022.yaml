    The ``net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-*`` kernel parameters were set to ``0``
    in previous releases to improve performance and it was left up to neutron
    to adjust these parameters when security groups are applied. This could
    cause situations where bridge traffic was not sent through iptables and
    this rendered security groups ineffective. This could allow unexpected
    ingress and egress traffic within the cloud.

    These kernel parameters are now set to ``1`` on all hosts by the
    ``openstack_hosts`` role, which ensures that bridge traffic is always
    sent through iptables.
