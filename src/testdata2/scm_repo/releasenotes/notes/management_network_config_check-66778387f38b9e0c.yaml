upgrade:
  - The dynamic_inventory script previously set the provider network
    attributes ``is_container_address`` and ``is_ssh_address`` to True
    for the management network regardless of whether a deployer had them
    configured this way or not. Now, these attributes must be configured
    by deployers and the dynamic_inventory script will fail if they are
    missing or not True.
