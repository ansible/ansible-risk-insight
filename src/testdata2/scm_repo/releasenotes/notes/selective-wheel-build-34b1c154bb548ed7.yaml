features:
  - The repo build process now selectively builds python packages
    based on whether each OpenStack service group has any hosts in
    it. If there are no hosts in the group, the list of python
    packages for the service will not be built. This behaviour can
    be optionally changed to force all python packages to be built
    by setting ``repo_build_wheel_selective`` to ``no``.
