features:
  - When ``venvwithindex=True`` and ``ignorerequirements=True`` are both specified
    in ``rally_git_install_fragments`` (as was previously the default), this
    results in rally being installed from PyPI without any constraints being
    applied. This results in inconsistent builds from day to day, and can cause
    build failures for stable implementations due to new library releases.
    Going forward, we remove the ``rally_git_*`` overrides in
    ``playbooks/defaults/repo_packages/openstack_testing.yml`` so that
    the integrated build installs rally from PyPI, but with appropriate
    constraints applied.
