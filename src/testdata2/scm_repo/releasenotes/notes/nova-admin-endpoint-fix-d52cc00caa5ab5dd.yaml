upgrade:
  - A new nova admin endpoint will be registered with the suffix ``/v2.1/%(tenant_id)s``. The nova admin endpoint
    with the suffix ``/v2/%(tenant_id)s`` may be manually removed.
fixes:
  - The nova admin endpoint is now correctly registered as ``/v2.1/%(tenant_id)s`` instead of ``/v2/%(tenant_id)s``.
