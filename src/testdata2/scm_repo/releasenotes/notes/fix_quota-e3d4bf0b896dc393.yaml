    Octavia is creating vms, securitygroups, and other things in its
    project. In most cases the default quotas are not big enough. This
    will adjust them to (configurable) reasonable values.
security:
  - |
    Avoid setting the quotas too high for your cloud since this can
    impact the performance of other servcies and lead to a potential
    Denial-of-Service attack if Loadbalancer quotas are not set
    properly or RBAC is not properly set up.
