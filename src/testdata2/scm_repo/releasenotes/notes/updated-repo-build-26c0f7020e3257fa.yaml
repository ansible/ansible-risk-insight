features:
  - Repeatable deployments are now easier since the manifest files for
    OpenStack software uses the exact content from an upstream repository.
    Specific commits or tags can be referenced within the manifest.  The
    ``yaprt`` package is no longer used to build the repo.
  - Developers can specify additional python packages for the repo build
    process by creating YAML files within ``/etc/openstack_deploy/``.
    Refer to the `documentation on adding packages <http://docs.openstack.org/developer/openstack-ansible/developer-docs/extending.html#build-the-environment-with-additional-python-packages>`_ for more details.
upgrade:
  - The ``repo-store-source.yml`` playbook has been removed as it is no longer
    needed.
