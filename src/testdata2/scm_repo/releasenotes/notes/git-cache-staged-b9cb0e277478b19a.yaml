features:
  - The repo build process is now able to synchronize a git cache from the
    deployment node to the repo server. The git cache path on the deployment
    node is set using the variable ``repo_build_git_cache``. If the
    deployment node hosts the repo container, then the folder will be
    symlinked into the bind mount for the repo container. If the deployment
    node does not host the repo container, then the contents of the folder
    will be synchronised into the repo container.
