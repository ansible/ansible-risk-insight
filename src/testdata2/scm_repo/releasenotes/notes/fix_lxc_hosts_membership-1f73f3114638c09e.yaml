fixes:
  - Metal hosts were being inserted into the ``lxc_hosts``
    group, even if they had no containers (Bug 1660996).
    This is now corrected for newly configured hosts. In addition, any
    hosts that did not belong in ``lxc_hosts`` will be removed on the
    next inventory run or playbook call.
