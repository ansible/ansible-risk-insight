    The Linux Security Module (LSM) that is appropriate for the Linux
    distribution in use will be automatically enabled by the security role by
    default. Deployers can opt out of this change by setting the following
    Ansible variable:

    .. code-block:: yaml

        security_enable_linux_security_module: False

    The documentation for STIG V-51337 has more information about how each
    LSM is enabled along with special notes for SELinux.
