issues:
  - |
    Ubuntu Cloud Archive (UCA) does not contain Ubuntu Bionic distro packages
    for Victoria, so only source install/upgrade path (default) will work
    correctly for Ubuntu 18.04.
upgrade:
  - |
    Deployments which follows distro path (services are installed from distro
    packages rather then in virtualenvs) should upgrade Ubuntu 18.04 -> 20.04
    before performing OpenStack Ussuri -> Victoria upgrade, since Ubuntu Cloud
    Archive does not provide Victoria system packages for 18.04.
