issues:
  - The variables
    ``haproxy_keepalived_(internal|external)_cidr`` now has a default
    set to ``169.254.(2|1).1/24``. This is to prevent Ansible
    undefined variable warnings.
    Deployers must set values for these variables for a working
    haproxy with keepalived environment when using more than one
    haproxy node.
