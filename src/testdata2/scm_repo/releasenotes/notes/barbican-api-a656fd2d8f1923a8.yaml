    Barbican service was renamed to barbican-api. During upgrade old barbican
    service will be stopped and barbican-api will be started instead. Also
    `barbican_*_program_name` was removed since had no effect and wasn't used.
    Instead variable `barbican_*_enabled` was introduced to ease enabling
    barbican services like barbican-worker, barbican-keystone-listener and
    barbican-retry.
