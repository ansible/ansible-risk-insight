upgrade:

    The EPEL repository is only installed and configured when the deployer sets
    ``security_enable_virus_scanner`` to ``yes``. This allows the ClamAV
    packages to be installed. If ``security_enable_virus_scanner`` is set to
    ``no`` (the default), the EPEL repository will not be added.

    See
    `Bug 1702167 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/openstack-ansible/+bug/1702167>`_
    for more details.

    Deployers now have the option to prevent the EPEL repository from being
    installed by the role. Setting ``security_epel_install_repository`` to
    ``no`` prevents EPEL from being installed. This setting may prevent certain
    packages from installing, such as ClamAV.
