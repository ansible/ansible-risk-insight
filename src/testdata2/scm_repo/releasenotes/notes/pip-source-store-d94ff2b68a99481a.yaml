features:
  - The repo build process now has the ability to store the pip
    sources within the build archive. This ability is useful when
    deploying environments that are "multi-architecture",
    "multi-distro", or "multi-interpreter" where specific pre-build
    wheels may not be enough to support all of the deployment.
    To enable the ability to store the python source code within a
    given release, set the new option ``repo_build_store_pip_sources``
    to ``true``.
