  - The variable ``lxc_user_defined_container`` has been added to the
    lxc_container_create role allowing deployers to define the variable
    file loaded when creating a container. This option defaults to **null**
    which will instruct the role to create a container using the OS most closely
    assosiated with the underlying OS. This option can be set to either one of
    the roles built-in container types or use any variable file local to the
    deployment host.
