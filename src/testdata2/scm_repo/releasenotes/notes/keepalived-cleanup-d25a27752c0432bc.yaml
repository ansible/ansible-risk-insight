    If you had your own keepalived configuration file, please rename and
    move it to the openstack-ansible user space, for example by moving
    it to ```/etc/openstack_deploy/keepalived/keepalived.yml```.
    Our haproxy playbook does not load an external variable files anymore.
    The keepalived variable override system has been standardised to the
    same method used elsewhere.
