upgrade:
  - |
    The default queue policy has changed to ``^(?!(amq\.)|(.*_fanout_)|(reply_)).*``
    instead of ``^(?!amq\.).*`` for efficiency.
    The new HA policy excludes reply queues (these queues have a single consumer and TTL policy),
    fanout queues (they have the TTL policy) and
    amq queues (they are auto-delete queues, with a single consumer).
