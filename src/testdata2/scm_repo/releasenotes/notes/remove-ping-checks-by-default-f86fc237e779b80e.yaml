upgrade:
  - The ping check that happens inside keepalived to make sure that the server
    that runs it can reach 193.0.14.129 has been removed by default.  The
    functionality can continue to be used if you define the `keepalived_ping_address`
    in your `user_variables.yml` file to `193.0.14.129` or any IP of your choice.
