features:
  - |
    The service setup in keystone for magnum will now be executed
    through delegation to the ``magnum_service_setup_host`` which,
    by default, is ``localhost`` (the deploy host). Deployers can
    opt to rather change this to the utility container by implementing
    the following override in ``user_variables.yml``.

    .. code-block:: yaml

      magnum_service_setup_host: "{{ groups['utility_all'][0] }}"
  - |
    Instead of downloading images to the magnum API servers, the
    images will now download to the ``magnum_service_setup_host`` to
    the folder set in ``magnum_image_path`` owned by
    ``magnum_image_path_owner``.

deprecations:
  - |
    The variable ``magnum_requires_pip_packages`` is no longer required
    and has therefore been removed.
