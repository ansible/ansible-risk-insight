    Several environment variables have been added in the bootstrapping functions
    used by the gate-check-commit script. These variables can be used to skip
    various phases of the bootstrap during the gate-check-commit or
    bootstrap-ansible script execution.

    The environment variables added are:

    * ``SKIP_OSA_RUNTIME_VENV_BUILD``: Skip bootstrapping of the OSA ansible venv
      in bootstrap-ansible.sh
    * ``SKIP_OSA_BOOTSTRAP_AIO``: Skip execution of the bootstrap-aio playbook
      in gate-check-commit
    * ``SKIP_OSA_ROLE_CLONE``: Skip execution of the
      get-role-requirements-playbook in the bootstrap-ansible.sh script
