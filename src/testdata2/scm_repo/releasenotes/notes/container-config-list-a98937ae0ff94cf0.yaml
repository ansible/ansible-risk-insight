features:
  - The ``lxc-container-create`` role now consumes the variable
    ``lxc_container_config_list`` which should contain a list of the entries
    which should be added to the LXC container config file when the container
    is created. This feature is designed to be used in group_vars to ensure
    that containers are fully prepared at the time they are created, thus
    cutting down the number of times containers are restarted during
    deployments and upgrades.
