features:
  - An option to disable the ``machinectl`` quota system has been changed. The
    variable ``lxc_host_machine_quota_disabled`` is a Boolean with a default of
    **false**. When this option is set to **true** it will disable the
    ``machinectl`` quota system.
  - The options ``lxc_host_machine_qgroup_space_limit`` and
    ``lxc_host_machine_qgroup_compression_limit`` have been added allowing a
    deployer to set **qgroup** limits as they see fit. The default value for
    these options is "none" which is effectively **unlimited**. These options
    accept any nominal size value followed by the single letter type, example
    ``64G``. These options are only effective when the option
    ``lxc_host_machine_quota_disabled`` is set to **false**.
