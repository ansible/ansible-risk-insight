    Deployers may require custom CA certificates installing on their openstack
    hosts or service containers. A new variable openstack_host_ca_certificates
    is added which is a list of certificates that should be copied from the
    deploy host to the target hosts. Certificates may be selectively deployed
    by defining the variable either in user_variables.yml or via host/group vars.
