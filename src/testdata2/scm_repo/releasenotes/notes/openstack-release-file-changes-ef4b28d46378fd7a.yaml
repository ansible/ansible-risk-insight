features:
  - The copy of the ``/etc/openstack-release`` file is now optional.
    To disable the copy of the file, set ``openstack_distrib_file``
    to ``no``.
  - The location of the ``/etc/openstack-release`` file placement
    can now be changed. Set the variable ``openstack_distrib_file_path``
    to place it in a different path.
upgrade:
  - |
    The variables used to produce the ``/etc/openstack-release`` file
    have been changed in order to improve consistency in the name
    spacing according to their purpose.

    ``openstack_code_name`` --> ``openstack_distrib_code_name``
    ``openstack_release`` --> ``openstack_distrib_release``

    Note that the value for ``openstack_distrib_release`` will
    be taken from the variable ``openstack_release`` if it is set.
