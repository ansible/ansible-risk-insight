    Mysql cnf files can now be properly overridden. The config_template
    module has been extended to support valueless options, such as those that
    are found in the my.cnf file(i.e. `quick` under the `mysqldump` section).
    To use valueless options, use the `ignore_none_type` attribute of the
    config_template module.
