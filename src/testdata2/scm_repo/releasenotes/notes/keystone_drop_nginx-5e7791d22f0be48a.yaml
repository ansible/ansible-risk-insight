deprecations:
  - |
    We removed multiple web server support for keystone and left only Apache
    since nginx is missing features required for federation setup.
    With this change following variables are deprecated and have no effect:

      * keystone_web_server
      * keystone_centos_nginx_mirror
      * keystone_centos_nginx_key
      * keystone_nginx_access_log_format_combined
      * keystone_nginx_access_log_format_extras
      * keystone_nginx_ports
      * keystone_nginx_extra_conf

    Nginx web server will be removed and replaced with Apache during upgrade.
