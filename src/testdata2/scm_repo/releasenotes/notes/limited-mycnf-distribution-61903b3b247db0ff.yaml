  - The distribution of the ``.my.cnf`` database access configuration file
    which contains sensitive root credentials has now been limited to only
    be distributed to containers and hosts which require it for
    troubleshooting purposes. It is recommended that this file be removed
    from all hosts and containers. The only containers that should have
    the file are the Utility container and the Galera containers. This may
    be done by executing ``ansible 'all:!galera:!utility' -m shell -a 'rm
    -f /root/.my.cnf'`` from the ``/opt/openstack-ansible/`` directory.
