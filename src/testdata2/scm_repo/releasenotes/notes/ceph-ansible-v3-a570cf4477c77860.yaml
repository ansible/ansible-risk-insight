upgrade:
  - The ceph-ansible integration has been updated to support the ceph-ansible
    v3.0 series tags. The new v3.0 series brings a significant refactoring of
    the ceph-ansible roles and vars, so it is strongly recommended to consult
    the upstream `ceph-ansible documentation
    <http://docs.ceph.com/ceph-ansible/master/>`_ to perform any required
    vars migrations before you upgrade.
