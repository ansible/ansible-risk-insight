features:
  - To ensure the deployment system remains clean the Ansible execution environment is
    contained within a virtual environment. The virtual environment is created at
    "/opt/ansible-runtime" and the "ansible.*" CLI commands are linked within /usr/local/bin
    to ensure there is no interruption in the deployer workflow.
deprecations:
  - Installation of Ansible on the root system, outside of a virtual environment, will
    no longer be supported.
