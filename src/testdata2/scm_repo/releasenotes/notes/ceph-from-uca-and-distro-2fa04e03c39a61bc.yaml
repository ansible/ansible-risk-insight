    Support had been added to install the ceph_client packages and
    dependencies from Ceph.com, Ubuntu Cloud Archive (UCA), or the
    operating system's default repository.

    The ``ceph_pkg_source`` variable controls the install source for the
    Ceph packages. Valid values include:

    * ``ceph``: This option installs Ceph from a ceph.com repo. Additional
      variables to adjust items such as Ceph release and regional download
      mirror can be found in the variables files.

    * ``uca``: This option installs Ceph from the Ubuntu Cloud Archive. Additional
      variables to adjust items such as the OpenStack/Ceph release can be
      found in the variables files.

    * ``distro``: This options installs Ceph from the operating system's default
      repository and unlike the other options does not attempt to manage
      package keys or add additional package repositories.
