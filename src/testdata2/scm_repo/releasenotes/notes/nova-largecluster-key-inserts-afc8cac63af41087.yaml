features:
  - The nova SSH public key distribution has been made a lot faster
    especially when deploying against very large clusters. To support
    larger clusters the role has moved away from the "authorized_key"
    module and is now generating a script to insert keys that may
    be missing from the authorized keys file. The script is saved on all
    nova compute nodes and can be found at
    ``/usr/local/bin/openstack-nova-key.sh``. If ever there is a need to
    reinsert keys or fix issues on a given compute node the script can be
    executed at any time without directly running the ansible playbooks
    or roles.
