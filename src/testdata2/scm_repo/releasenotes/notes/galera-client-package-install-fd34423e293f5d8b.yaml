  - The ``galera_client_package_install`` option can now
    be specified to handle whether packages are installed
    as a result of the ``openstack-ansible-galera_client``
    role running. This will default to ``true``, but can be
    set to ``false`` to prevent package installs. This is
    useful when deploying the ``my.cnf`` client configuration
    file on hosts that already have Galera installed.
