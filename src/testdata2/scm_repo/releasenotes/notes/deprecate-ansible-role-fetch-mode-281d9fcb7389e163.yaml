    There was previously an environment variable (``ANSIBLE_ROLE_FETCH_MODE``)
    to set whether the roles in ansible-role-requirements.yml were fetched using
    ansible-galaxy or using git, however the default has been git for some time
    ansible since the use of the ``ceph-ansible`` respoitory for ceph deployment,
    using ansible-galaxy to download the roles does not work properly. This
    functionality has therefore been removed.
