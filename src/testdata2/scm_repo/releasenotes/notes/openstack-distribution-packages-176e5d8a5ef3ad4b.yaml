    Deployers can now set the ``install_method`` to either ``source`` (default)
    or ``distro`` to choose the method for installing OpenStack services on the
    hosts. This only applies to *new* deployments.  Existing deployments which
    are source based, cannot be converted to the new ``distro`` method.
    For more information, please refer to the `Deployment Guide <https://docs.openstack.org/project-deploy-guide/openstack-ansible>`_.
