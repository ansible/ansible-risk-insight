    During upgrade password for ``galera_monitoring_user_password`` will be
    generated and set while running galera-server role.
    In case any third-party software relies on this user, it should be updated
    to use password. You can also override variable to
    ``galera_monitoring_user_password: ""`` to not use password for auth and
    preserve previous behaviour.
