    New variables 'keepalived_internal_ping_address' and
    'keepalived_external_ping_address' allow deployments to decouple liveness
    checks for HAProxy accessibility via internal and external networks. The
    previous 'keepalived_ping_address' variable is maintained for backwards
    compatibility.
