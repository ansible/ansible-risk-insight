    The repo server no longer uses pypiserver, so it has been removed.
    Along with this, the following variables have also been removed.

    * ``repo_pypiserver_port``
    * ``repo_pypiserver_pip_packages``
    * ``repo_pypiserver_package_path``
    * ``repo_pypiserver_bin``
    * ``repo_pypiserver_working_dir``
    * ``repo_pypiserver_start_options``
    * ``repo_pypiserver_init_overrides``
