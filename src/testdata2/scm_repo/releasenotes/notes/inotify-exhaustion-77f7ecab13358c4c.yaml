    The number of inotify watch instances available is limited system wide
    via a sysctl setting. It is possible for certain processes, such as
    pypi-server, or elasticsearch from the ops repo to consume a large number
    of inotify watches. If the system wide maximum is reached then any process
    on the host or in any container on the host will be unable to create a new
    inotify watch. Systemd uses inotify watches, and if there are none available
    it is unable to restart services. The processes which synchronise the repo
    server contents between infra nodes also relies on inotify watches. If the
    repo servers fail to synchronise, or services fail to restart when expected
    check the the inotify watch limit which is defined in the sysctl value
    fs.inotify.max_user_watches. Patches have merged to increase these limits,
    but for existing environments or those which have not upgraded to a recent
    enough point release may have to apply an increased limit manually.
