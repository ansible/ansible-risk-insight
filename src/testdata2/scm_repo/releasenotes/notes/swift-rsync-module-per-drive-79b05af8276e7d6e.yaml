features:
  - Enable rsync module per object server drive by setting
    the ``swift_rsync_module_per_drive`` setting to ``True``.
    Set this to configure rsync and swift to utilise individual
    configuration per drive. This is required when disabling
    rsyncs to individual disks. For example, in a disk full
    scenario.
upgrade:
  - The ``swift_max_rsync_connections`` default value has
    changed from 2 to 4 in order to match the OpenStack swift
    documented value.
