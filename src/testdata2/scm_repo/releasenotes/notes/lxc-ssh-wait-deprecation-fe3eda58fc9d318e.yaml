upgrade:
  - The var ``lxc_container_ssh_delay`` along with SSH specific ping checks
    have been removed in favor of using Ansible's wait_for_connection module,
    which will not rely on SSH to the container to verify connectivity. A new
    variable called ``lxc_container_wait_params`` has been added to allow
    configuration of the parameters passed to the ``wait_for_connection``
    module.
deprecations:
  - The var ``lxc_container_ssh_delay`` along with SSH specific ping checks
    have been removed in favor of using Ansible's wait_for_connection module,
    which will not rely on SSH to the container.
