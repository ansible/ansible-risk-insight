features:
  - When using the pypy python interpreter you can configure the garbage
    collection (gc) settings for pypy. Set the minimum GC value using the
    ``swift_pypy_gc_min`` variable. GC will only happen when the memory
    size is above this value. Set the maximum GC value using the
    ``swift_pypy_gc_max`` variable. This is the maximum memory heap size
    for pypy.
    Both variables are not defined by default, and will only be used if
    the values are defined and ``swift_pypy_enabled`` is set to ``True``.
