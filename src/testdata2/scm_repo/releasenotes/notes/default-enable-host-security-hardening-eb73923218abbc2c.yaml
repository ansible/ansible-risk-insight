  - Host security hardening is now applied by default using the
    ``openstack-ansible-security`` role. Developers can opt out by setting the
    ``apply_security_hardening`` Ansible variable to ``false``. For more
    information about the role and the changes it makes, refer to the
    `openstack-ansible-security documentation <http://docs.openstack.org/developer/openstack-ansible-security/>`_.
