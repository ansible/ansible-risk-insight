features:
  - The container creation process now allows ``overlayfs`` to be set as the
    ``lxc_container_backing_store``. When this is set it will use a snapshot
    of the base container to build the containers. The ``overlayfs``
    backing store is not recommended to be used for production unless the host
    kernel version is 3.18 or higher.
