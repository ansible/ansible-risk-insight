features:
  - The openstack-ansible-memcached_server role includes
    a new override, ``memcached_connections`` which is
    automatically calculated from the number of memcached
    connection limit plus additional 1k to configure
    the OS nofile limit. Without proper nofile limit
    configuration, memcached will crash in order to support
    higher parallel connection TCP/Memcache counts.
