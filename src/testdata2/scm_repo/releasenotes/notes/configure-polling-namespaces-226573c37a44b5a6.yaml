    ceilometer-polling services running on compute nodes did not have the
    polling namespace configured. Because of this they used the default value of
    running all pollsters from the central and compute namespaces. But the
    pollsters from the central namespace don't have to run on every compute
    node. This is fixed by only running the compute pollsters on compute nodes.
