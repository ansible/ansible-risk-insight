features:
  - The ``swift_rsync_reverse_lookup`` option has been added. This setting
    will handle whether rsync performs reverse lookups on client IP
    addresses, and will default to ``False``. We recommend leaving this
    option at ``False``, unless DNS or host entries exist for each swift
    host's replication address.
upgrade:
  - The default behaviour of rsync, to perform reverse lookups, has
    been changed to ``False``. This can be set to ``True`` by
    setting the ``swift_rsync_reverse_lookup`` variable to ``True``.
