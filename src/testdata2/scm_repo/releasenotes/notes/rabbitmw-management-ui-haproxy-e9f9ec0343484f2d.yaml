features:
  - The RabbitMQ Management UI is now available
    through HAProxy on port 15672. The default
    userid is ``monitoring``. This user can be
    modified by changing the parameter
    ``rabbitmq_monitoring_userid`` in the file
    ``user_variables.yml``. Please note that ACLs
    have been added to this HAProxy service by
    default, such that it may only be accessed by
    common internal clients.  Reference
    ``playbooks/vars/configs/haproxy_config.yml``
upgrade:
  - The variable ``rabbitmq_monitoring_password``
    has been added to ``user_secrets.yml``. If
    this variable does not exist, the RabbitMQ
    monitoring user will not be created.
