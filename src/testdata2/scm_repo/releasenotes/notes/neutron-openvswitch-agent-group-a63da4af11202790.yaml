upgrade:
  - The new host group ``neutron_openvswitch_agent`` has been added to the ``env.d/neutron.yml``
    and ``env.d/nova.yml`` environment configuration files in order to support the implementation
    of Open vSwitch. Deployers must ensure that their environment configuration files are updated
    to include the above group name. Please see the example implementations in
    `env.d/neutron.yml <https://github.com/openstack/openstack-ansible/blob/stable/newton/etc/openstack_deploy/env.d/neutron.yml>`_
    and
    `env.d/nova.yml <https://github.com/openstack/openstack-ansible/blob/stable/newton/etc/openstack_deploy/env.d/nova.yml>`_.
