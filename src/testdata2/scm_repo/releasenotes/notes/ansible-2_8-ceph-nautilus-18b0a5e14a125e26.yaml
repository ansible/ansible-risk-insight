features:

    The ansible version used by OSA is updated from the 2.7 to the 2.8 series.
    This requires an upgrade of ceph-ansible to 4.0 and this in turn
    requires an upgrade of ceph from Mimic to Nautilus. This version dependancy
    applies where OSA uses ceph-ansible directly to deploy the ceph infrastructure,
    but not when OSA is integrated with an externally provisioned ceph cluster.
upgrade:
  - |
    Any ceph infrastructure components (OSDs, MONs etc) deployed using the
    OSA/ceph-ansible tooling will be upgraded to the Ceph Nautilus release.
    Deployers should verify that this upgrade is suitable for their environment
    before commencing a major upgrade to Train, and consult the ceph-ansible
    and ceph release notes for Nautilus. For integration with external ceph
    clusters where OSA does not deploy any of the ceph cluster infrastructure,
    overrides can be used to select the specific version of ceph repositories
    used by the OSA ceph_client ansible role.
