    As support for Centos-7 is removed from openstack-ansible in the Victoria
    release it is no longer necessary to support LXC2 configuration syntax in
    the lxc_container_create ansible role. The version of LXC is now assumed
    to be 3 or greater, and any LXC configuration keys that are being overriden
    by the deployer in the variable lxc_container_config_list should be updated
    to be LXC3 syntax as these will no longer be be converted by ansible code..
