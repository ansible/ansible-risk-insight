features:
  - The repo server file system structure has been updated to
    allow for multiple Operating systems running multiple
    architectures to be run at the same time and served from
    a single server without impacting pools, venvs, wheel
    archives, and manifests. The new structure follows the
    following pattern `$RELEASE/$OS_TYPE-$ARCH` and has been
    applied to *os-releases*, *venvs*, and *pools*.
