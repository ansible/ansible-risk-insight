    The use of the nginx package repository on RedHat derived operating
    systems is no longer required as there is a new enough version of the
    nginx package in the standard distro repos now. The variables
    ``repo_centos_nginx_mirror`` and ``repo_centos_nginx_key`` are removed from
    the repo_server role and no longer have any effect.
