features:
  - Whether the Neutron DHCP Agent, Metadata Agent or LinuxBridge Agent
    should be enabled is now dynamically determined based on the
    ``neutron_plugin_type`` and the ``neutron_ml2_mechanism_drivers``
    that are set. This aims to simplify the configuration of Neutron
    services and eliminate the need for deployers to override the
    entire ``neutron_services`` dict variable to disable these services.
