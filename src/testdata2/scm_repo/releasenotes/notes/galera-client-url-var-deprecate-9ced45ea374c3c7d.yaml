features:
  - The ``galera_client`` role will default to using the ``galera_repo_url``
    URL if the value for it is set. This simplifies using an alternative
    mirror for the MariaDB server and client as only one variable needs to
    be set to cover them both.
deprecations:
  - The variables ``galera_client_apt_repo_url`` and ``galera_client_yum_repo_url``
    are deprecated in favour of the common variable ``galera_client_repo_url``.
