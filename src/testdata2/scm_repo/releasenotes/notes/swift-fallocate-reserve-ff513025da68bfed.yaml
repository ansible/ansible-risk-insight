features:
  - The ``fallocate_reserve` option can now be set (in bytes or as a percentage) for swift
    by using the ``swift_fallocate_reserve`` variable in
    ``/etc/openstack_deploy/user_variables.yml``. This value is the amount of space to
    reserve on a disk to prevent a situation where swift is unable to remove objects due
    to a lack of available disk space to work with. The default value is 1% of the total
    disk size.
upgrade:
  - The ``swift_fallocate_reserve`` default value has changed from 10737418240
    (10GB) to 1% in order to match the OpenStack swift default setting.
