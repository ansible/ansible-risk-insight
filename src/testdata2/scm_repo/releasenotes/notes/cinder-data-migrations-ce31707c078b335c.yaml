features:
  - The ``os_cinder`` role now provides for doing
    online data migrations once the db sync has
    been completed. The data migrations will not
    be executed until the boolean variable
    ``cinder_all_software_updated`` is true. This
    variable will need to be set by the playbook
    consuming the role.
