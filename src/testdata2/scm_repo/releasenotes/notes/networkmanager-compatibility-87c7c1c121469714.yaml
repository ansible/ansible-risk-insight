    The ``lxcbr0`` bridge now allows NetworkManager to control it, which
    allows for networks to start in the correct order when the system boots.
    In addition, the ``NetworkManager-wait-online.service`` is enabled to
    ensure that all services that require networking to function, such as
    ``keepalived``, will only start when network configuration is complete.
    These changes are only applied if a deployer is actively using
    NetworkManager in their environment.
