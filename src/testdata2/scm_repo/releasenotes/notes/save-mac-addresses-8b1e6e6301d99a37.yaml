features:
  - MAC addresses for containers with a fixed MAC (`lxc_container_fixed_mac`
    variable) are now saved to the ``/etc/ansible/facts.d/mac.fact`` file.
    Should such a container be destroyed but not removed from inventory,
    the interfaces will be recreated with the same MAC address when the
    container is recreated.
