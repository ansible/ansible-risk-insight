upgrade:
  - Ceilometer no longer manages alarm storage when Aodh
    is enabled. It now redirects alarm-related requests to
    the Aodh API. This is now auto-enabled when Aodh is
    deployed.
  - Overrides for ceilometer ``aodh_connection_string``
    will no longer work. Specifying an Aodh connection
    string in Ceilometer was deprecated within Ceilometer
    in a prior release so this option has been removed.
