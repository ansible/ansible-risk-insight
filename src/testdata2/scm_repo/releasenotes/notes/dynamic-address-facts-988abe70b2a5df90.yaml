    Only minimal facts are gathered when calculating the 'dynamic address fact'
    for the neutron, nova and cinder playbooks. On compute and network nodes
    this previously took a significant amount of time, and gathering minimal
    facts will speed this up. Facts are instead gathered for interfaces
    specified in provider_networks for the storage, overlay and management
    networks.

    Only minimal facts are gathered when calculating the 'dynamic address fact'
    for the neutron, nova and cinder playbooks. If overrides are in use for
    setting the neutron tunnel address, or various storage or management
    addresses which rely on ansible fact gathering to provide variables of the
    form ansible_<interface>, it is likley that these facts will no longer be
    gathered by default. The new variable dynamic_address_gather_filter is
    available to specify a shell-style (fnmatch) wildcard to specify the set
    of facts gathered early in the neutron/nova/cinder playbooks.
