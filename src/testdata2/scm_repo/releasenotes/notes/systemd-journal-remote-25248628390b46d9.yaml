  - A new playbook ``infra-journal-remote.yml`` to ship journals has
    been added. Physical hosts will now ship the all available systemd
    journals to the logging infrastructure. The received journals will
    be split up by host and stored in the `/var/log/journal/remote`
    directory. This feature will give deployers greater access/insight
    into how the cloud is functioning requiring nothing more that the
    systemd built-ins.
