deprecations:
  - The log path, ``/var/log/keystone`` is no longer used to capture service
    logs. All logging for the Keystone service will now be sent directly to the
    systemd journal.
other:
  - When running keystone with apache(httpd) all apache logs will be stored in
    the standard apache log directory which is controlled by the distro specific
    variable ``keystone_apache_default_log_folder``.
