features:
  - LXC containers will now have a proper RFC1034/5 hostname set during post
    build tasks. A localhost entry for 127.0.1.1 will be created by converting
    all of the "_" in the ``inventory_hostname`` to "-". Containers will be
    created with a default domain of *openstack.local*.
    This domain name can be customized to meet your deployment needs by
    setting the option ``lxc_container_domain``.
