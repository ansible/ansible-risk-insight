features:
    - Neutron connectivity agents will now be deployed on baremetal within the
      "network_hosts" defined within the ``openstack_user_config.yml``.

upgrade:
    - When upgrading there is nothing a deployer **must** immediately do to
      run neutron agent services on hosts within the ``network_hosts`` group.
      Simply executing the playbooks will deploy the neutron servers on the
      baremetal machines and will leave all existing agents containers alone.
    - It is recommended for deployers to clean up the **neutron_agents**
      container(s) after an upgrade is complete and the cluster has been
      verified as stable. This can be done by simply disabling the neutron
      agents running in the **neutron_agent** container(s), re-balancing the
      agent services targeting the new baremetal agents, deleting the
      container(s), and finally removing the container(s) from inventory.
