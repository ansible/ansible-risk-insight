    The variable ``security_sysctl_enable_tcp_syncookies`` has replaced
    ``security_sysctl_tcp_syncookies`` and it is now a boolean instead of an
    integer.  It is still enabled by default, but deployers can disable TCP
    syncookies by setting the following Ansible variable:

    .. code-block:: yaml

       security_sysctl_enable_tcp_syncookies: no
