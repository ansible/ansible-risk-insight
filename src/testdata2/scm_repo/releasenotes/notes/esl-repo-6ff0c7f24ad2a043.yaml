features:
  - A new repository for installing modern erlang from ESL
    (erlang solutions) has been added giving us the ability
    to install and support modern stable erlang over numerous
    operating systems.
  - The ability to set the RabbitMQ repo URL for both erlang
    and RabbitMQ itself has been added. This has been done to
    allow deployers to define the location of a given repo without
    having to fully redefine the entire set of definitions for a
    specific repository. The default variables `rabbitmq_gpg_keys`,
    `rabbitmq_repo_url`, and `rabbitmq_erlang_repo_url` have been
    created to facilitate this capability.
upgrade:
  - Changing to the ESL repos has no upgrade impact. The version
    of erlang provided by ESL is newer than that what is found in
    the distro repos. Furthermore, a pin has been added to
    ensure that APT always uses the ESL repos as it's preferred
    source which has been done to simply ensure APT is always
    pointed at ESL.
fixes:
  - Based on documentation from RabbitMQ
    [ https://www.rabbitmq.com/which-erlang.html ] this change
    ensures the version of erlang we're using across distros is
    consistent and supported by RabbitMQ.
