features:
  - |
    A new ansible role (ansible-role-pki) is introduced to manage the creation
    of server certificates and certificate authorities. A self signed Root CA
    and Intermediate CA are created on the deploy host and are used to provide
    TLS for RabbitMQ, and with the default configuration also a self-signed server
    certificate for HAProxy. A set of new variables with the prefix
    openstack_pki_* are introduced which allow a deployer to customise and
    extend the set of certificate authorities which are created. Root certificate
    authorities are installed into the trust store of all hosts and containers
    allowing a complete trust chain to be formed across the deployment which
    has never previously been possible.
upgrade:
  - |
    It is now mandatory to use a verifiable SSL certificate and Certificate
    Authority trust chain for the RabbitMQ installation. This can be achieved
    automatically through the new ansible role ansibe-role-pki with appropriate
    addition of openstack_pki_* variables.
    Any existing deployments which use the rabbitmq_user_ssl_* variables must
    ensure that the supplied certificates can be verified by a CA certificate
    installed into the trust store of each host and container. This can be
    achieved through supplying the CA certificate on the deploy host and using
    overrides from the openstack_hosts role to install it.
deprecations:
  - |
    The variables `haproxy_ssl_self_signed_regen` and `haproxy_ssl_self_signed_subject`
    are removed and the equivalent functionaility from the ansible-role-pki
    variables should be used instead.
