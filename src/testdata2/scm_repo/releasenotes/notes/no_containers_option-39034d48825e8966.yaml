    A new option has been added allowing deployers to disable any and all
    containers on a given host. The option `no_containers` is a boolean
    which, if undefined, will default to *false*. This option can be added
    to any host in the `openstack_user_config.yml` or via an override in
    `conf.d`. When this option is set to *true* the given host will be
    treated as a baremetal machine. The new option mirrors the existing
    environmental option `is_metal` but allows deployers to target
    specific hosts instead of entire groups.
