features:
  - You can force update the translations direct
    from Zanata by setting ``horizon_translations_update``
    to ``True``. This will call the ``pull_catalog``
    option built into ``horizon-manage.py``. You should
    only use this when testing translations, otherwise
    this should remain set to the default of ``False``.
