features:
    - This role now optionally enables your compute nodes' KVM kernel
      module nested virtualization capabilities, by setting nova_nested_virt_enabled
      to true. Depending on your distribution and libvirt version, you might need to
      set additional variables to fully enabled nested virtualization.
      For details, please see https://docs.openstack.org/nova/latest/admin/configuration/hypervisor-kvm.html#nested-guest-support.
