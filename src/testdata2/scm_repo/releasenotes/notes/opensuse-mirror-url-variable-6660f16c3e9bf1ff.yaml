    Deployers can set ``lxc_hosts_opensuse_mirror_url`` to use their
    preferred mirror for the openSUSE repositories. They can also set the
    ``lxc_hosts_opensuse_mirror_obs_url`` if they want to set a different
    mirror for the OBS repositories. If they want to use the same mirror in
    both cases then they can leave the latter variable to its default value.
    The full list of mirrors and their capabilities can be obtained at
    http://mirrors.opensuse.org/
