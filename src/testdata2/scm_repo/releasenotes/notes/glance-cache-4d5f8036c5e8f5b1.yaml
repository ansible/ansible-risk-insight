    Glance containers will now bind mount the default glance cache directory
    from the host when glance_default_store is set to file and nfs is not in
    use.  With this change, the glance file cache size is no longer restricted
    to the size of the container file system.

  - |
    Glance containers will be rebooted to add the glance cache bind mount if
    glance_default_store is set to file and nfs is not in use.
