    Added 2 new varibles for all groups - `oslomsg_notify_policies` and
    `oslomsg_rpc_policies`. These variables contain default rabbitmq
    policies, which will be applied for every rabbitmq vhost. As for now they
    will enable [HA mode](https://www.rabbitmq.com/ha.html) for all vhosts.
    If you would like to disable HA mode just set these variables to empty
    lists inside your `user_config.yml`
