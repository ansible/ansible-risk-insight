features:
  - Introduced new variable ``cinder_volume_usage_audit_send_actions_enabled``
    to allow the deployer to disable the send actions option in
    cinder-volume-usage-audit service unit. To have lowest possible 
    footprint, the default value would be true to not change the behaviour 
    of the cinder-volume-usage-audit in existing deployments.
