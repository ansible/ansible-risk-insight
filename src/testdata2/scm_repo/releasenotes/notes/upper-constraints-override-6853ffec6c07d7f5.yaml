features:
  - The ``repo_build`` role now provides the ability to override the
    upper-constraints applied which are sourced from OpenStack and
    from the global-requirements-pins.txt file. The variable
    ``repo_build_upper_constraints_overrides`` can be populated with
    a list of upper constraints. This list will take the highest
    precedence in the constraints process, with the exception of
    the pins set in the git source SHAs.
