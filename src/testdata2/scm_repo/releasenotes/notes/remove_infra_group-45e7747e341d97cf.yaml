upgrade:
  - The ``infra_hosts`` and ``infra_containers`` inventory groups
    have been removed. No containers or services were assigned to
    these groups exclusively, and the usage of the groups has been
    supplanted by the ``shared-infra_*`` and ``os-infra_*`` groups
    for some time. Deployers who were using the groups should adjust
    any custom configuration in the ``env.d`` directory to assign
    containers and/or services to other groups.
