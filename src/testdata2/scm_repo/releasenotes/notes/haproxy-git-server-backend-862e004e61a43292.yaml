upgrade:
  - Haproxy has a new backend to support using the repo
    server nodes as a git server. The new backend
    is called "repo_git" and uses port "9418".
    Default ACLs have been created to lock down the port's
    availability to only internal networks originating from
    an RFC1918 address.
