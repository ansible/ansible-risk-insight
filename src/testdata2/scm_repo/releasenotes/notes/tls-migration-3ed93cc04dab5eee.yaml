    Nova now defaults to to using the "QEMU-native TLS" feature
    for live migrations, rather than the deprecated SSH method.
    A pre-existing PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) setup is
    required.

    QEMU-native TLS requires all compute hosts to accept TCP connections on
    port 16514 and port range 49152 to 49261.
