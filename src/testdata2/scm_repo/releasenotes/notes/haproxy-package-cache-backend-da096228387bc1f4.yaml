features:
  - The repo server will now be used as a package manager
    cache.
upgrade:
  - Haproxy has a new backend to support using the repo
    server nodes as a package manager cache. The new backend
    is called "repo_cache" and uses port "3142" and a single
    active node. All other nodes within the pool are backups
    and will be promoted if the active node goes down.
    Default ACLs have been created to lock down the port's
    availability to only internal networks originating from
    an RFC1918 address.
