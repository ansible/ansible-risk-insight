    The ``sysstat`` package was installed on all distributions, but it was
    only configured to run on Ubuntu and OpenSUSE. It would not run on CentOS
    due to bad SELinux contexts and file permissions on
    ``/etc/cron.d/sysstat``. This has been fixed and ``sysstat`` now runs
    properly on CentOS.
