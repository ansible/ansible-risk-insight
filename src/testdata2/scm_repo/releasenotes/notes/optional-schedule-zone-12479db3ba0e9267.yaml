    The default variable `nova_default_schedule_zone` was previously set by
    default to ``nova``. This default has been removed to allow the default
    to be set by the nova code instead. Deployers wishing to maintain the
    default availability zone of nova must now set the variable as a
    user_variables.yml or group_vars override.
