deprecations:
  - |
    The following variables have been deprecated and will have no effect:

      * ``haproxy_ssl_cert_path``
      * ``haproxy_ssl_key``
      * ``haproxy_ssl_pem``
      * ``haproxy_ssl_ca_cert``

    These variables were responsible for the path haproxy looked for
    certificates on the destination hosts.

    Variables were replaced in favor of ``haproxy_ssl_cert_path`` since the exact
    path to certificates will be dynamically set based on the VIP that is used
    for the frontend
