features:
  - The ``openstack-ansible-galera_server`` role will now prevent
    deployers from changing the ``galera_cluster_name`` variable
    on clusters that already have a value set in a running galera
    cluster.
    You can set the new ``galera_force_change_cluster_name``
    variable to ``True`` to force the ``galera_cluster_name``
    variable to be changed.
    We recommend setting this by running the galera-install.yml playbook
    with ``-e galera_force_change_cluster_name=True``, to avoid
    changing the ``galera_cluster_name`` variable unintentionally.
    Use with caution, changing the ``galera_cluster_name`` value
    can cause your cluster to fail, as the nodes won't join if restarted
    sequentially.
