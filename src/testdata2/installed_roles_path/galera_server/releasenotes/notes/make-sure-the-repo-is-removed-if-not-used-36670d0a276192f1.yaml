fixes:
  - The percona repository stayed in placed even after
    a change of the variable ``use_percona_upstream``.
    From now on, the percona repository will not be
    present unless the deployer decides to
    ``use_percona_upstream``. This also fixes a bug
    of the presence of this apt repository after an
    upgdrade from Mitaka.
