features:
  - You can specify the ``galera_package_arch`` variable
    to force a specific architecture when installing
    percona and qpress packages. This will be automatically
    calculated based on the architecture of the
    ``galera_server`` host. Acceptable values are ``x86_64``
    for ``Ubuntu-16.04`` and ``RHEL 7``, and ``ppc64le`` for
    ``Ubuntu-16.04``.
