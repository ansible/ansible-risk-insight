features:
  - |
    The extra packages percona packages used by the ppc64le
    are now downloaded by the Ansible deployment host by
    default, as opposed to the target hosts. Once downloaded
    the packages are pushed up to the target hosts.
    This behaviour may be adjusted by setting
    ``galera_server_extra_package_downloader`` to
    ``target-host``.
    The packages are downloaded to the path set in
    ``galera_server_extra_package_path``.
deprecations:
  - |
    The following variables have been removed as they no
    longer serve any purpose.

    * ``galera_package_arch``
    * ``percona_package_download_validate_certs``
    * ``percona_package_url``
    * ``percona_package_fallback_url``
    * ``percona_package_sha256``
    * ``percona_package_path``
    * ``qpress_package_download_validate_certs``
    * ``qpress_package_url``
    * ``qpress_package_fallback_url``
    * ``qpress_package_sha256``
    * ``qpress_package_path``

    The functionality previously using these variables has
    been transitioned to using a simpler data structure.
