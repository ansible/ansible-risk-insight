fixes:
  - Add architecture-specific locations for percona-xtrabackup and qpress,
    with alternate locations provided for ppc64el due to package inavailability
    from the current provider.
issues:
  - Deployments on ppc64le are limited to Ubuntu 16.04 for the Newton
    release of OpenStack-Ansible.
