deprecations:
  - The compression option in the ``galera_server`` role has been removed due
    to the fact that it is not recommended by MariaDB anymore.  This means that
    all the dependencies from Percona such as QPress are no longer necessary.

  - The following variables have been removed because they are no longer used.

    * ``galera_percona_xtrabackup_repo``
    * ``use_percona_upstream``
    * ``galera_xtrabackup_compression``
    * ``galera_server_percona_distro_packages``

  - The variable ``galera_xtrabackup_threads`` has been renamed to
    ``galera_mariabackup_threads`` to reflect the change in the SST provider.
