# Unfortunately yum is case-insensitive, and RDO has mariadb-* packages,
# while the MariaDB repo has MariaDB-* packages and they conflict.
# To work around this we have to query for any installed RDO/CentOS
# packages using rpm, then remove them. We have to remove them without
# dependencies, otherwise for distro package installation types on shared
# hosts it removes far too many packages.
