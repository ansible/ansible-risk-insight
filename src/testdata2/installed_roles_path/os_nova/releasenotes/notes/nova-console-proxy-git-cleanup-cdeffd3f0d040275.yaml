upgrade:
  - Cleanup tasks are added to remove the nova console git
    directories ``/usr/share/novnc`` and ``/usr/share/spice-html5``,
    prior to cloning these inside the nova vnc and spice
    console playbooks. This is necessary to guarantee
    that local modifications do not break git clone
    operations, especially during upgrades.
