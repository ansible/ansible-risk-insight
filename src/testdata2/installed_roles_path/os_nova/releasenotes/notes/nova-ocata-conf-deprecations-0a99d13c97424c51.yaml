  - Several ``nova.conf`` options that were deprecated have
    been removed from the ``os_nova`` role. The
    following OpenStack-Ansible variables are no longer
    used and should be removed from any variable override
    files.

    * ``nova_dhcp_domain``
    * ``nova_quota_fixed_ips``
    * ``nova_quota_floating_ips``
    * ``nova_quota_security_group_rules``
    * ``nova_quota_security_groups``
