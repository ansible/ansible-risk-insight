features:
  - The ``nova-api``, and ``nova-metadata``  services
    have moved to run as uWSGI applications. You can
    override their uwsgi configuration files using the
    ``nova_api_os_compute_uwsgi_ini_overrides``, and
    ``nova_api_metadata_uwsgi_ini_overrides`` settings.
upgrade:
  - The ``nova-placement`` service now runs as a uWSGI
    application that is not fronted by an nginx
    web-server by default. After upgrading, if the
    ``nova-placement`` service was running on a host
    or container without any other services requiring
    nginx, you should manually remove nginx.
deprecations:
  - Settings related to nginx and the placement
    will no longer serve any purpose, and should
    be removed. Those settings are as follows -
    ``nova_placement_nginx_access_log_format_extras``,
    ``nova_placement_nginx_access_log_format_combined``,
    ``nova_placement_nginx_extra_conf``,
    ``nova_placement_uwsgi_socket_port``, and
    ``nova_placement_pip_packages``.
