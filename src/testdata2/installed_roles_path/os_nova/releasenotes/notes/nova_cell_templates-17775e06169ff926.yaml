upgrade:
  - |
    During upgrade your current Nova cell mapings will be converted to usage
    of the `Template URLs <https://docs.openstack.org/nova/latest/user/cells.html#template-urls-in-cell-mappings>`_.
    This means, that your changes of transport_url or [database]/connection
    in ``nova.conf`` will be reflected by nova-conductor in cells just after
    service restart, without need to explicitly run
    ``nova-manage cell_v2 update_cell``.
