    The ``nova_cpu_mode`` Ansible variable has been removed by default,
    to allow Nova to detect the default value automatically. Hard-coded
    values can cause problems. You can still set ``nova_cpu_mode`` to
    enforce a ``cpu_mode`` for Nova.
    Additionally, the default value for the ``qemu`` ``libvirt_type``
    is set to ``none`` to avoid issues caused with ``qemu`` 2.6.0.
