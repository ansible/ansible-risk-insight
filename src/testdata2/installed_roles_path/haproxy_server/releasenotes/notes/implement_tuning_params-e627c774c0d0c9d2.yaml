features:
  - Haproxy-server role allows to set up tunable parameters.
    For doing that it is necessary to set up a dictionary of options in the
    config files, mentioning those which have to be changed (defaults for the
    remaining ones are programmed in the template). Also "maxconn" global option
    made to be tunable.
upgrade:
  - The ``haproxy_bufsize`` variable has been removed and made a part of the
    ``haproxy_tuning_params`` dictionary.
