upgrade:
  - |
    There's no need in providing neither `http-01-address` nor `http-01-port`
    options with `haproxy_ssl_letsencrypt_setup_extra_params`, as they are now
    configured with corresponding variables
    `haproxy_ssl_letsencrypt_certbot_bind_address` and
    `haproxy_ssl_letsencrypt_certbot_backend_port`
features:
  - |
    Added variable `haproxy_ssl_letsencrypt_certbot_challenge` which is default
    to `http-01`. As for now really tested in only `http-01` but we keep door
    open for adding support for more challanges, like `dns-01`. For `http-01`
    all required arguments are passed, but oth other challanges you might want
    to use `haproxy_ssl_letsencrypt_setup_extra_params` to pass missing
    arguments.
