    If Horizon dashboard of OSA installation has a public FQDN, is it
    now possible to use LetsEncrypt certification service. Certificate
    will be generated within HAProxy installation and a cron entry to
    renew the certificate daily will be setup.
    Note that there is no certificate distribution implementation at
    this time, so this will only work for a single haproxy-server
    environment.
