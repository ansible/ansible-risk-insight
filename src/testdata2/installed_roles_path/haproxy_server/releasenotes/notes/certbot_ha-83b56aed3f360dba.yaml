    Multiple HAProxy nodes can now be deployed in an HA configuration with
    keepalived and LetsEncrypt certificates. Certbot can be treated as a
    backend service for haproxy and acme-challenge requests from LetsEncrypt
    can be directed to whichever HAProxy server is running a certificate
    renewal. New variables are defined for frontend ACLs and options
    to be passed to Certbot which enable this new feature, but the majority
    of the required configuration is done via the existing HAProxy service
    setup. An example is provided in the documentation.
