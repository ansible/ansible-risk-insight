upgrade:
  - |
    If you have defined ``haproxy_tuning_params`` in your deployment, make sure
    that before upgrade all keys are valid haproxy options. For example,
    instead of ``chksize: 16384`` you should set ``tune.chksize: 16384``.
    Otherwise invalid config will be generated and haproxy will fail on
    startup.
    No upgrade scripts are provided for this change as well as no backwards
    compatability.
other:
  - |
    Restriction on parameters that can be passed to ``haproxy_tuning_params``
    has been released. This means, that any tuning parameter can be passed in
    key/value format.
fixes:
  - |
    By default we increase ``tune.maxrewrite`` as otherwise while using CSP
    headers, their size could exceed allowed buffer.
    Also deployers can override this value if needed.
