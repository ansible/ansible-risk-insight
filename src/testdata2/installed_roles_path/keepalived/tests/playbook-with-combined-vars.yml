# This is a standalone playbook to install keepalived
# on all nodes, having the first node the master, and
# the rest of nodes as fallback. It is showing an
# example of service, haproxy, to work with it.
# In your own environment, you should probably
# have your own group/host vars to define the content
# of keepalived_haproxy_combined_example.yml.
# Please note that keepalived_haproxy_combined_example.yml
# relies on calculations to have a single var file.
# You don't need that, it's just for convenience.
# To see a simpler example (with more detailed variables)
# check the other playbook: playbook-with-fine-grained-vars.yml

    include_vars: "keepalived_haproxy_combined_example.yml"
