===================
Centralized logging
===================

OpenStack-Ansible configures all instances to send syslog data to a
container (or group of containers) running rsyslog. The rsyslog server
containers are specified in the ``log_hosts`` section of the
``openstack_user_config.yml`` file.

The rsyslog server container(s) have logrotate installed and configured with
a 14 day retention. All rotated logs are compressed by default.

Finding logs
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Logs are accessible in multiple locations within an OpenStack-Ansible
deployment:

* The rsyslog server container collects logs in ``/var/log/log-storage`` within
  directories named after the container or physical host.
* Each physical host has the logs from its service containers mounted at
  ``/openstack/log/``.
* Each service container has its own logs stored at
  ``/var/log/<service_name>``.
