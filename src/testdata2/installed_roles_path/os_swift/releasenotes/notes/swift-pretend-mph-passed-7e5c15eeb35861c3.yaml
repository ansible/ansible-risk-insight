features:
  - The ``pretend_min_part_hours_passed`` option can now be
    passed to swift-ring-builder prior to performing a
    rebalance. This is set by the
    ``swift_pretend_min_part_hours_passed`` boolean variable.
    The default for this variable is False. We recommend setting
    this by running the os-swift.yml playbook with
    ``-e swift_pretend_min_part_hours_passed=True``, to avoid
    resetting ``min_part_hours`` unintentionally on every run.
    Setting ``swift_pretend_min_part_hours_passed`` to True will
    reset the clock on the last time a rebalance happened, thus
    circumventing the min_part_hours check. This should only be
    used with extreme caution. If you run this command and deploy
    rebalanced rings before a replication pass completes, you may
    introduce unavailability in your cluster. This has an end-user
    imapct.
