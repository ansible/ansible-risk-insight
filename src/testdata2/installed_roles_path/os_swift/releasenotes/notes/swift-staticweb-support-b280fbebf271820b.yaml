features:
  - The ``os_swift`` role will now include the swift "staticweb" middleware
    by default.
upgrade:
  - When upgrading a Swift deployment from Mitaka to Newton it should be noted
    that the enabled middleware list has changed. In Newton the "staticweb"
    middleware will be loaded by default. While the change adds a feature it is
    non-disruptive in upgrades.
