features:
  - The ``openstack-ansible-os_swift`` role will now prevent
    deployers from changing the ``swift_hash_path_prefix`` and
    ``swift_hash_path_suffix`` variables on clusters that already
    have a value set in ``/etc/swift/swift.conf``.
    You can set the new ``swift_force_change_hashes`` variable to
    ``True`` to force the ``swift_hash_path_`` variables to be
    changed.
    We recommend setting this by running the os-swift.yml playbook
    with ``-e swift_force_change_hashes=True``, to avoid changing
    the ``swift_hash_path_`` variables unintentionally.
    Use with caution, changing the ``swift_hash_path_`` values
    causes end-user impact.
