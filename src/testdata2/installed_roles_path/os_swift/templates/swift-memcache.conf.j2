[memcache]
# You can use this single conf file instead of having memcache_servers set in
# several other conf files under [filter:cache] for example. You can specify
# multiple servers separated with commas, as in: 10.1.2.3:11211,10.1.2.4:11211
# (IPv6 addresses must follow rfc3986 section-3.2.2, i.e. [::1]:11211)
# memcache_servers = 127.0.0.1:11211

#
# Sets how memcache values are serialized and deserialized:
# 0 = older, insecure pickle serialization
# 1 = json serialization but pickles can still be read (still insecure)
# 2 = json serialization only (secure and the default)
# To avoid an instant full cache flush, existing installations should
# upgrade with 0, then set to 1 and reload, then after some time (24 hours)
# set to 2 and reload.
# In the future, the ability to use pickle serialization will be removed.
