features:

    Added variable `ceilometer_pipeline_default_file_path` to be able to define
    user provided pipeline file like for other ceilometer configs. In order to
    avoid deployment of pipeline.yaml you can set in your user variables:
    `_ceilometer_pipeline_yaml_overrides: {}`
upgrade:
  - |
    We have changed a way of the deployment of ceilometer pipeline.yml. Now we
    use overrides to leave the behaviour and defaults, however you might want
    to double check if no conflicts with your current overrides exist.
