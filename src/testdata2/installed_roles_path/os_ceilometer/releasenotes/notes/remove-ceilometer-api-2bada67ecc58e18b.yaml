    The ceilometer-api service/container can be removed as part of O->P
    upgrades. A ceilometer-central container will be created to contain
    the central ceilometer agents.
deprecations:
  - |
    The ceilometer API service is now deprecated. OpenStack-Ansible no longer
    deploys this service. To make queries against metrics, alarms, and/or
    events, please use the gnocchi, aodh, and panko APIs, respectively.
