    Due to the smart-reources implementation, variables, related to custom git path
    of exact config files were removed. Now all config files are taken from
    upstream git repo, but overrides and client configs are still supported.
    The following variables are not supported now:
    * ceilometer_git_config_lookup_location
    * ceilometer_data_meters_git_file_path
    * ceilometer_event_definitions_git_file_path
    * ceilometer_gnocchi_resources_git_file_path
    * ceilometer_loadbalancer_v2_meter_definitions_git_file_path
    * ceilometer_osprofiler_event_definitions_git_file_path
    * ceilometer_polling_git_file_path
    If you are maintaining custom ceilometer git repository, you still may use
    ``ceilometer_git_repo`` variable, to provide url to your git repository.
