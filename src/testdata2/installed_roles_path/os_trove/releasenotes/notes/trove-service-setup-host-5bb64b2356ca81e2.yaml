features:
  - |
    The trove service setup in keystone will now be executed
    through delegation to the ``trove_service_setup_host`` which,
    by default, is ``localhost`` (the deploy host). Deployers can
    opt to rather change this to the utility container by implementing
    the following override in ``user_variables.yml``.

    .. code-block:: yaml

      trove_service_setup_host: "{{ groups['utility_all'][0] }}"

deprecations:
  - |
    The variable ``trove_requires_pip_packages`` is no longer required
    and has therefore been removed.
