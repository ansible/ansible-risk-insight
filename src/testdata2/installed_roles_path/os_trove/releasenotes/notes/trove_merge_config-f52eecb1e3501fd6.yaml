upgrade:
  - |
    Trove service specific config files, like ``trove-conductor.conf`` and
    ``trove-taskmanager.conf``, were removed and all functionality was merged
    to the ``trove.conf`` file. So you need to ensure, that all overriden
    options are now placed for the trove.conf file.
  - |
    Default Trove service username has been changed from ``admin_trove_user``
    to ``trove``. You might want to manually delete ``admin_trove_user``
    after upgrade or override new default.
  - |
    Default Trove service project name has been changed from
    ``trove_for_trove_usage`` to ``service``. You might want to manually delete
    ``trove_for_trove_usage`` project after upgrade or override new default.
deprecations:
  - |
    Variables ``trove_taskmanager_config_overrides`` and
    ``trove_conductor_config_overrides`` were removed along with affected config
    files. You should use ``trove_config_overrides`` to override trove
    configuration.
  - |
    Removed variable ``trove_provider_ip_from_q`` and
    ``trove_container_net_name``. If you need to change network which will be
    used for guests inside trove containers, please use variables
    ``trove_provider_network`` or ``trove_provider_net_iface``.
  - |
    Removed variables ``trove_admin_user_name`` and
    ``trove_service_tenant_name``. Please use ``trove_service_user_name``
    and ``trove_service_project_name`` correspondingly to manage username
    and project name which will be used for auth in keystone.
