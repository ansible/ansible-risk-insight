features:
  - New variables have been added to allow a deployer to customize
    a aodh systemd unit file to their liking.
  - The task dropping the aodh systemd unit files now uses the
    ``config_template`` action plugin allowing deployers access to
    customize the unit files as they see fit without having to
    load extra options into the defaults and polute the generic
    systemd unit file with jinja2 variables and conditionals.
