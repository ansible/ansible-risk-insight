upgrade:
  - |
    Aodh migrated from usage of Apache mod_wsgi or native daemon to uWSGI
    daemon. This means, that `aodh_apache_*` variables are not available and has no effect
    anymore.

    During upgrade process role will drop `aodh_service_port` from apache
    listeners (ports.conf) and aodh virtualhost, which by default means
    misconfigured apache service (since it won't have any listeners) unless
    it's aio build and this apache server is in use by other role/service.
    Apache server won't be dropped from aodh_api hosts, so deployers
    are encoureged to remove it manually.
