# The systemd mounts dictionary is a set of mounts that will be created. The
#  dictionary can contain the following options:
#  `config_overrides` -- (optional) used to inject extra configuration options into the mount file.
#  `what` -- (required) Define what will be mounted. This can be a network target.
#  `where` -- (required) Where will the "what" be mounted. Required when type is not swap.
#  `type` -- (required) The type of file system that will be mounted.
#  `options` -- (optional) Any optioned required to make the mount point work.
#                          If no options are provided the default will be used.
#                          This list is comma separted. See
#                          `systemd_default_mount_options` for more details.
#  `state` -- (optional) system state of the mount point. The default will omit
#                        the state so that it is not started or stopped
#                        unessisarily. If it is desirable for this role to
#                        start/stop the mount immediately this can be done by
#                        setting the state to ["started", "stopped", "absent"].
#                        If the state is absent the mount will be stopped and
#                        unit file deleted.
#  `enabled` -- (optional) Set a Boolean to enable or disable the mount, the
#                          default is set to "true".
