features:
  - |
    Added variables ``systemd_run_dir`` and ``systemd_lock_dir`` that allows
    to control run and lock path for directories that will be used by systemd
    services. Variables should not include service name since it will be added
    by default at the end of the provided path.
    These variables could be also defined as keys inside ``systemd_services``
    and this will have prescedence over default behaviour.
  - |
    Default run path for systemd services has been changed to ``/run`` and
    lock path to ``/run/lock``.
