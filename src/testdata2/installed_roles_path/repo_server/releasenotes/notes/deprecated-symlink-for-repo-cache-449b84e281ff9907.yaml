deprecations:
  - |
    In OSA deployments prior to Queens, if ``repo_git_cache_dir`` was set
    to a folder which existed on a repo container host then that folder
    would be symlinked to the repo container bind mount instead of
    synchronising its contents to the repo container. This functionality
    is deprecated in Queens and will be removed in Rocky. The ability to
    make use of the git cache still exists, but the folder contents will
    be synchronised from the deploy host to the repo container. If you
    have made use of the symlink functionality previously, please move
    the contents to a standard folder and remove the symlink.
