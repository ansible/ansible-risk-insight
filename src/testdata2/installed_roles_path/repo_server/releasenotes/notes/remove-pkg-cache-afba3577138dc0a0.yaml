deprecations:
  - |
    The package cache on the repo server has been removed. If caching of
    packages is desired, it should be setup outside of OpenStack-Ansible
    and the variable ``lxc_container_cache_files`` (for LXC containers)
    or ``nspawn_container_cache_files_from_host`` (for nspawn containers)
    can be used to copy the appropriate host configuration from the host
    into the containers on creation. Alternatively, environment variables
    can be set to use the cache in the host /etc/environment file prior
    to container creation, or the ``deployment_environment_variables``
    can have the right variables set to use it. The following variables
    have been removed.

    * ``repo_pkg_cache_enabled``
    * ``repo_pkg_cache_port``
    * ``repo_pkg_cache_bind``
    * ``repo_pkg_cache_dirname``
    * ``repo_pkg_cache_dir``
    * ``repo_pkg_cache_owner``
    * ``repo_pkg_cache_group``
