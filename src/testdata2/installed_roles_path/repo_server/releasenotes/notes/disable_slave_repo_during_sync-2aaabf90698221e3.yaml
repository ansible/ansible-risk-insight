fixes:
  - In order to ensure that the appropriate data is delivered to requesters from the repo servers,
    the slave repo_server web servers are taken offline during the synchronisation process. This
    ensures that the right data is always delivered to the requesters through the load balancer.
security:
  - A sudoers entry has been added to the repo_servers in order to allow the nginx user to stop and
    start nginx via the init script. This is implemented in order to ensure that the repo sync
    process can shut off nginx while synchronising data from the master to the slaves.
