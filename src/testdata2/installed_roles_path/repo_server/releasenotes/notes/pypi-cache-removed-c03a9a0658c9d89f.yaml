    The repo server's reverse proxy for pypi has now been removed,
    leaving only the pypiserver to serve packages already on the
    repo server. The attempt to reverse proxy upstream pypi turned
    out to be very unstable with increased complexity for deployers
    using proxies or offline installs. With this, the variables
    ``repo_nginx_pypi_upstream`` and ``repo_nginx_proxy_cache_path``
    have also been removed.
