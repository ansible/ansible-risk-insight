upgrade:
  - The variable ``proxy_env_url`` is now used by the apt-cacher-ng jinja2
    template to set up an HTTP/HTTPS proxy if needed.
fixes:
  - The apt-cacher-ng daemon does not use the proxy server specified in
    environment variables. The proxy server specified in the
    ``proxy_env_url`` variable is now set inside the apt-cacher-ng
    configuration file.
