    The repo server now implements nginx as a reverse proxy for python
    packages sourced from pypi. The initial query will be to a local
    deployment of pypiserver in order to serve any locally built packages,
    but if the package is not available locally it will retry
    the query against the upstream pypi mirror set in the variable
    ``repo_nginx_pypi_upstream`` (defaults to pypi) and cache the response.
