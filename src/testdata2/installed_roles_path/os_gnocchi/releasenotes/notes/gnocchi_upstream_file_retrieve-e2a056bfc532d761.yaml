features:
  - Several configuration files that were not
    templated for the ``os_gnocchi` role are now
    retrieved from git. The git repository used can
    be changed using the
    ``gnocchi_git_config_lookup_location`` variable.
    By default this points to ``git.openstack.org``.
    These files can still be changed using the
    ``gnocchi_x_overrides`` variables.
