    ``gnocchi_service_project_name`` now set by to ``service`` even for
    deployments involving Swift. Nowadays cielometer.middleware exclude
    ``service`` project by default, so no additional protection is required.
    In case you want to preserve current ``gnocchi_service_project_name``,
    define it equal to ``gnocchi_swift`` in your user_variables.yml
