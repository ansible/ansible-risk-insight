# MemcacheD could set 'PrivateDevices=True' for its systemd unit by default when
# installed into a container. This provides some additional security, but it
# causes problems with creating mount namespaces on CentOS 7 with systemd 219.
# While the security enhancements are helpful on bare metal hosts with
# multiple services running, they are not as helpful when MemcacheD is running
# in a container with its own isolated namespaces.
