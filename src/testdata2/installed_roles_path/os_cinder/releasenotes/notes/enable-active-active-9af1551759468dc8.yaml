features:
  - Cinder is deployed with Active-Active enabled by default if you are using
    Ceph as a backend storage.
issues:
  - The previous way of using a common backend_host across all deployments
    was not recommended by the Cinder team and it will cause duplicate
    messages that cause problems in the environment.
upgrade:
  - It is possible that you may need to use the cinder-manage command to migrate
    volumes to a specific host.  In addition, you will have to remove the old
    ``rbd:volumes`` service which will be stale.
