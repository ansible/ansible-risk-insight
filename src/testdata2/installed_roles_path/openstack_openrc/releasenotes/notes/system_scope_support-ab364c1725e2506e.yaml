    The role now supports creating system scoped credentials alongside
    project scoped credentials. The default behavior of the role did not
    changed, until ``openrc_system_scope`` variable was set to ``true``.
    If the ``openrc_system_scope`` is ``true`` the default cloud in
    clouds.yaml will set to system scoped credentials and another credentials
    named ``default_project_scope`` will get created with project scoped
    credentials. Due to usage of openrc file in other roles, the opposite
    logic applies to openrc files, which means if ``openrc_system_scope``
    is set to ``true`` the credentials in openrc will set to project scoped
    credentials and another openrc filec named ``openrc.system_scope`` will
    get created with system scoped credentials and will be placed in
    destination of ``openrc_system_file_dest`` variable.
