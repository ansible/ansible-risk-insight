features:
  - The container cache preparation process now allows ``overlayfs`` to be set
    as the ``lxc_container_backing_store``. When this is set a base container
    will be created using a name of the form
    `<linux-distribution>`-`distribution-release>`-`<host-cpu-architecture>`.
    The container will be stopped as it is not used for anything except to be
    a backing store for all other containers which will be based on a snapshot
    of the base container. The ``overlayfs`` backing store is not recommended
    to be used for production unless the host kernel version is 3.18 or
    higher.
