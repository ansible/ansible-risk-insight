features:
  - The variable ``lxc_image_cache_server_mirrors`` has been added to
    the "lxc_hosts" role. This is a list type variable and gives
    deployers the ability to specify multiple lxc-image mirrors at the
    same time.

deprecations:
  - The variable ``lxc_image_cache_server`` has been deprecated in the
    "lxc_hosts" role. By default this value will pull the first item
    out of ``lxc_image_cache_server_mirrors`` list which is only done
    for compatibility (legacy) purposes. The default string type
    variable, ``lxc_image_cache_server``, will be removed from the
    "lxc_hosts" role in the in "R" release.
