    The LXC container cache preparation process now copies package
    repository configuration from the host instead of implementing
    its own configuration. The following variables are therefore
    unnecessary and have been removed:

    * ``lxc_container_template_main_apt_repo``
    * ``lxc_container_template_security_apt_repo``
    * ``lxc_container_template_apt_components``
