upgrade:
  - The variable ``lxc_host_machine_volume_size`` now accepts any valid size
    modifier acceptable by ``truncate -s`` and ``machinectl set-limit``.
    prior to this change the option assumed an integer was set for some value
    in gigabytes. All acceptable values can be seen within the
    `documentation for machinectl <https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/machinectl.html#set-limit%20%5BNAME%5D%20BYTES>`_
features:
  - An option to disable the ``machinectl`` quota system has been added. The
    variable ``lxc_host_machine_quota_disabled`` is a Boolean with a default of
    **true**. When this option is set to **true** it will disable the
    ``machinectl`` quota system.
other:
  - The variable ``lxc_host_machine_volume_size`` is used to set the size of
    the default sparse file as well as define a limit within the ``machinectl``
    quota system. When the ``machinectl`` quota system is enabled deployers
    should appropriately set this value to the size of the container volume,
    even when not using a sparse file.
  - The container image cache within machinectl has been set to "64G" by
    default.
