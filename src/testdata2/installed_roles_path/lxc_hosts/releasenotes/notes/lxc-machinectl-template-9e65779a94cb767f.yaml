features:
  - A new LXC container template has been added which will allow us to better
    manage containers on the host machines we support. The new template uses
    the `machinectl` command to create container rootfs using the existing
    cache. This in-turn will provide easier management of container images,
    faster build times, and the ability to instantly clone a container (or a
    given variant) without impacting a containers state. This new lxc container
    create template, and the features it provides, will only impact new
    containers created allowing deployers to safely adopt this change in any
    existing environment.
