    To provide compatibility with Centos-8 the LXC cache preparation has
    been greatly simplified to remove the requirement for machinectl and
    btrfs, which is a combination not available on Centos-8. This has
    the side effect of machinectl no longer being a supported backing
    store for LXC.
