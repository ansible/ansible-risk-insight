fixes:
  - With the release of CentOS 7.6, deployments were breaking and becoming very
    slow when we restart dbus in order to catch some PolicyKit changes. However,
    those changes were never actaully used so they were happening for no reason.
    We no longer make any modifications to the systemd-machined configuration
    and/or PolicyKit to maintain upstream compatibility.
