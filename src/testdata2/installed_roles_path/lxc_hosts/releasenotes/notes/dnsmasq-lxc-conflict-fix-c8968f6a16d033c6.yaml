    In Ubuntu the ``dnsmasq`` package actually includes
    init scripts and service configuration which
    conflict with LXC and are best not included. The
    actual dependent package is ``dnsmasq-base``. The
    package list has been adjusted and a task added
    to remove the ``dnsmasq`` package and purge the
    related configuration files from all LXC hosts.
