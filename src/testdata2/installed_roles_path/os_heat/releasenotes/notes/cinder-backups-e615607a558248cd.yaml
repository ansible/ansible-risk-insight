    Deployers can set ``heat_cinder_backups_enabled`` to enable or disable
    the cinder backups feature in heat. If heat has cinder backups enabled,
    but cinder's backup service is disabled, newly built stacks will be
    undeletable.

    The ``heat_cinder_backups_enabled`` variable is set to ``false`` by
    default.
