deprecations:
  - |
    Variable ``glance_nfs_local_directory`` has been renamed to
    ``glance_images_local_directory`` to better reflect purpose of
    the variable. ``glance_nfs_local_directory`` remains for backwards
    compatability but will be removed in Zed release.
  - |
    Variable ``glance_nfs_client`` has been replaced with
    ``glance_remote_client``. New variable has new keys for defining mounts
    to cover wider range of supported filesystems.
    Compatability for ``glance_nfs_client`` has been kept until Zed release.
