  - For the ``os_glance`` role, the systemd unit ``RestartSec`` value which
    controls the time between the service stop and start when restarting has

    faster. This value can be adjusted by using the
    ``glance_*_init_config_overrides`` variables which use the
    ``config_template`` task to change template defaults.
