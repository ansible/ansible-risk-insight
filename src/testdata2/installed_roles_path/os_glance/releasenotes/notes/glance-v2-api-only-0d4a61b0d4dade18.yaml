upgrade:
  - |
    The glance v1 API is now disabled by default as the API is scheduled
    to be removed in Queens.
  - |
    The glance registry service is now disabled by default as it is not
    required for the v2 API and is scheduled to be removed in the future.
    The service can be enabled by setting ``glance_enable_v2_registry``
    to ``True``.
deprecations:
  - |
    The ``glance_enable_v1_registry`` variable has been removed. When using
    the glance v1 API the registry service is required, so having a variable
    to disable it makes little sense. The service is now enabled/disabled
    for the v1 API using the ``glance_enable_v1_api`` variable.
fixes:
  - |
    When the ``glance_enable_v2_registry`` variable is set to ``True`` the
    corresponding ``data_api`` setting is now correctly set. Previously it
    was not set and therefore the API service was not correctly informed
    that the registry was operating.
