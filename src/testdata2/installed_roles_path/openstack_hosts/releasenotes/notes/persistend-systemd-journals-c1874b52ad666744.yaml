    Persistent systemd journals are now enabled. This allows deployers to keep
    older systemd journals on disk for review. The disk space requirements are
    extremely low since the journals are stored in binary format. The default
    location for persistent journals is in ``/var/log/journal``.

    Deployers can opt out of this change by setting
    ``openstack_host_keep_journals`` to ``no``.
