upgrade:
  - |
    If you have overridden your
    ``openstack_host_specific_kernel_modules``, please
    remove its group matching, and move that override
    directly to the appropriate group.

    Example, for an override like:

    .. code-block:: yaml

        - name: "ebtables"
          pattern: "CONFIG_BRIDGE_NF_EBTABLES"
          group: "network_hosts"

    You can create a file for the network_host group,
    inside its group vars folder
    ``/etc/openstack_deploy/group_vars/network_hosts``,
    with the content:

    .. code-block:: yaml

        - name: "ebtables"
          pattern: "CONFIG_BRIDGE_NF_EBTABLES"
