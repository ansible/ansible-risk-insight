    In order to accomodate Centos-8 Stream support, it is necessary require
    the minimum version of Centos-8 Classic to be 8.3. There are breaking
    changes between Stream and Classic versions prior to 8.3 which break
    ansible code that detects major/minor versions of Centos. Before
    upgrading to Wallaby, deployers should ensure that their Centos hosts
    are updated to 8.3.
