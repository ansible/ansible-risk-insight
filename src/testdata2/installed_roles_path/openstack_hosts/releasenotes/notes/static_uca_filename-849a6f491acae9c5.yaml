    Any user that is coming from Pike or below on Ubuntu should modify
    its ``user_external_repos_list``, switching its ubuntu cloud archive
    repository from ``state: present`` to ``state: absent``.
    From now on, UCA will be defined with the filename ``uca``. If the deployer
    wants to use its mirror, he can still override the variable ``uca_repo``
    to point to its mirror. Alternatively, the deployer can completely define
    which repos to add and remove, ignoring our defaults, by overriding
    ``openstack_hosts_package_repos``.
