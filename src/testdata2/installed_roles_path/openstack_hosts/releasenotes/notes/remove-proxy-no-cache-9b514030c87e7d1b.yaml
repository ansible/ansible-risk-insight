    Code which added 'Acquire::http:No-Cache true' to the host and container
    apt preferences when http proxy environment variables were set has been
    removed. This setting is only required when working around issues
    introduced by badly configured http proxies. In some cases proxies can
    improperly cache the apt Releases and Packages files leading to package
    installation errors. If a deployment is behind a badly configured proxy,
    the deployer can add the necessary apt config fragment as part of host
    provisioning. OSA will replicate that config into any containers that
    are created. This setting can be removed from existing deployments if
    required by manually deleting the file
    ``/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/00apt-no-cache`` from all host and containers.
