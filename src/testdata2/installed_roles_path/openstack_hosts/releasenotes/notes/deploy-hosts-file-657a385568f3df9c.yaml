features:

    In deployments where a separate host is used to manage the OpenStack
    Ansible configuration, the '/etc/hosts' file on that host will now include
    a section adding hostname to IP resolution for all hosts in the inventory.
    This can be enabled/disabled via 'openstack_host_manage_deploy_hosts_file'.
issues:
  - |
    Where a single OSA deploy host is used to manage multiple deployments, some
    delegated Ansible tasks are performed using hostnames rather than IP
    addresses due to Ansible issue 72776. Hostnames such as 'infra1' will be
    ambiguous, so use of separate hosts for each deployment is recommended.
