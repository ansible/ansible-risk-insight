# The output of 'rabbitmqctl -q cluster_status' looks like this:
# [{nodes,[{disc,[rabbit@container1,rabbit@container2,rabbit@container3]}]},
#  {running_nodes,[rabbit@container3,rabbit@container1,rabbit@container2]},
#  {cluster_name,
#        <<"rabbitmq_cluster1">>},
#  {partitions,[]},
#  {alarms,[{rabbit@container3,[]},
#           {rabbit@container1,[]},
#           {rabbit@container2,[]}]}]
#
# Our solution to get the cluster name out cleanly is inspired by
