features:
  - The ``rabbitmq_server`` role now supports configuring HiPE compilation
    of the RabbitMQ server Erlang code. This configuration option may improve
    server performance for some workloads and hardware. Deployers can
    override the ``rabbitmq_hipe_compile`` variable, setting a value of
    ``True`` if they wish to enable this feature.
