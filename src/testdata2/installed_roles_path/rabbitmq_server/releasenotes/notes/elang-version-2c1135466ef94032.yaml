features:
  - The option ``rabbitmq_erlang_version_spec`` has been added allowing
    deployers to set the version of erlang used on a given installation.
deprecations:
  - The use of the ``apt_package_pinning`` role as a meta dependency
    has been removed from the rabbitmq_server role. While the package
    pinning role is still used, it will now only be executed when the
    apt task file is executed.
