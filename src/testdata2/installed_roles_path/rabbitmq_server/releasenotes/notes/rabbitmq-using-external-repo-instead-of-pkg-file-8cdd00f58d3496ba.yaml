    RabbitMQ Server can now be installed from different
    methods: a deb file (default), from standard
    repository package and from external repository.
    Current behavior is unchanged. Please define
    ``rabbitmq_install_method: distro`` to use packages
    provided by your distribution or
    ``rabbitmq_install_method: external_repo`` to use
    packages stored in an external repo. In the case
    ``external_repo`` is used, the process will install
    RabbitMQ from the packages hosted by packagecloud.io,
    as recommended by RabbitMQ.
