upgrade:
  - |
    The data structure for ``ceph_gpg_keys`` has been changed to be a list of
    dicts, each of which is passed directly to the applicable apt_key/rpm_key
    module. As such any overrides would need to be reviewed to ensure that they
    do not pass any key/value pairs which would cause the module to fail.
  - |
    The default values for ``ceph_gpg_keys`` have been changed for all
    supported platforms and now use vendored keys. This means that the task
    execution will no longer reach out to the internet to add the keys,
    making offline or proxy-based installations easier and more reliable.
  - |
    A new value ``epel_gpg_keys`` can be overridden to use a different GPG key
    for the EPEL-7 RPM package repo instead of the vendored key used by default.
