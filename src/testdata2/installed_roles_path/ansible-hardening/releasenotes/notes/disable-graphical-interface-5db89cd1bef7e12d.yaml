    The security role now has tasks that will disable the graphical interface
    on a server using upstart (Ubuntu 14.04) or systemd (Ubuntu 16.04 and
    CentOS 7). These changes take effect after a reboot.

    Deployers that need a graphical interface will need to set the following
    Ansible variable:

    .. code-block:: yaml

        security_disable_x_windows: no
