features:
  - |
    AIDE is configured to skip the entire ``/var`` directory when it does the
    database initialization and when it performs checks. This reduces disk
    I/O and allows these jobs to complete faster.

    This also allows the initialization to become a blocking process and
    Ansible will wait for the initialization to complete prior to running the
    next task.
fixes:
  - |
    AIDE initialization is now always run on subsequent playbook runs when
    ``security_initialize_aide`` is set to ``yes``. The initialization will
    be skipped if AIDE isn't installed or if the AIDE database already exists.

    See `bug 1616281 <https://launchpad.net/bugs/1616281>`_ for more details.
