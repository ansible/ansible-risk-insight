    The sysctl configuration task was not skipping configurations where
    ``enabled`` was set to ``no``. Instead, it was removing configurations
    when ``enabled: no`` was set.

    There is now a fix in place that ensures any sysctl configuration with
    ``enabled: no`` will be skipped and the configuration will be left
    unaltered on the system.
