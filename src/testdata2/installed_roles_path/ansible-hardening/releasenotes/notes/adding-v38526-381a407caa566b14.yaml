    A task was added to disable secure ICMP redirects per the requirements in
    V-38526. This change can cause problems in some environments, so it is
    disabled by default. Deployers can enable the task (which disables secure
    ICMP redirects) by setting ``security_disable_icmpv4_redirects_secure`` to
    ``yes``.
