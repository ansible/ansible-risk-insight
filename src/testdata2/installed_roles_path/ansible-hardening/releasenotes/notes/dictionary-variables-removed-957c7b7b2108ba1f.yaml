fixes:
  - The dictionary-based variables in ``defaults/main.yml`` are now individual
    variables. The dictionary-based variables could not be changed as the
    documentation instructed. Instead it was required to override the entire
    dictionary. Deployers must use the new variable names to enable or disable
    the security configuration changes applied by the security role. For more
    information, see
    `Launchpad Bug 1577944 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/openstack-ansible/+bug/1577944>`_.
