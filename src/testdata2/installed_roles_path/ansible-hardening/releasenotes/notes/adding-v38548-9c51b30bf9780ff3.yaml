    A new task was added to disable ICMPv6 redirects per the requirements in
    V-38548. However, since this change can cause problems in running OpenStack
    environments, it is disabled by default. Deployers who wish to enable this
    task (and disable ICMPv6 redirects) should set
    ``security_disable_icmpv6_redirects`` to ``yes``.
