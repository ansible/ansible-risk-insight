    A task was added that restricts ICMPv4 redirects to meet the requirements
    of V-38524 in the STIG. This configuration is disabled by default since
    it could cause issues with LXC in some environments.

    Deployers can enable this configuration by setting an Ansible variable:

    .. code-block:: yaml

       security_disable_icmpv4_redirects: yes
