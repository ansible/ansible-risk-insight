The default AIDE configuration in CentOS 7, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7,
openSUSE Leap and SUSE Linux Enterprise 12 already uses SHA512 to validate
file contents and directories. No changes are required on these systems.

The tasks in the security role add a rule to end of the AIDE configuration on
Ubuntu systems that uses SHA512 for validation.
