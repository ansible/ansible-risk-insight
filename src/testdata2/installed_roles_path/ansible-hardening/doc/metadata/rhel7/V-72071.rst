CentOS 7 and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 already deploy a very secure AIDE
configuration that checks access control lists (ACLs) and extended attributes
by default. No configuration changes are applied on these systems.

However, Ubuntu lacks the rules that include ACL and extended attribute checks.
The tasks in the security role will add a small configuration block at the end
of the AIDE configuration file to meet the requirements of this STIG, as well
as V-72069.

openSUSE Leap and SUSE Linux Enterprise 12 also lack a rule to check ACLs and
extended attributes. The default configuration file is adjusted to include those
as well.
