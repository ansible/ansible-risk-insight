Although the STIG requires that GRUB 2 asks for a password whenever a user
attempts to enter single-user or maintenance mode, this change might be
disruptive in an emergency situation. Therefore, this change is not applied by
default.

Deployers that wish to opt in for this change should set two Ansible variables:

.. code-block:: yaml

    security_require_grub_authentication: yes
    security_grub_password_hash: grub.pbkdf2.sha512.10000.7B21785BEAFEE3AC...

The default password set in the security role is 'secrete', but deployers
should set a much more secure password for production environments. Use the
``grub2-mkpasswd-pbkdf2`` command to create a password hash string and use it
as the value for the Ansible variable ``security_grub_password_hash``.

.. warning::

    This change must be tested in a non-production environment first. Requiring
    authentication in GRUB 2 without proper communication to users could cause
    extensive delays in emergency situations.
