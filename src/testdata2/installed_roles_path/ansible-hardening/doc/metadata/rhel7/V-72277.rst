The tasks in the security role examine the filesystem for any ``.shosts`` or
``shosts.equiv`` files. If they are found, they are deleted.

The search for these files will take a very long time on systems with slow
disks or systems with a large amount of files. Therefore, this task is skipped
by default.

Deployers can opt in for this change by setting the following Ansible variable:

.. code-block:: yaml

    security_rhel7_remove_shosts_files: yes
