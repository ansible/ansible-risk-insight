The tasks in this role set ``net.ipv6.conf.all.accept_source_route`` to ``0``
by default. This prevents the system from forwarding source-routed IPv6
packets.

Deployers can opt out of this change by setting the following Ansible variable:

.. code-block:: yaml

    security_disallow_source_routed_packet_forward_ipv6: no

Refer to `"IPv6 source routing: history repeats itself" <https://lwn.net/Articles/232781/>`_
for more details on IPv6 source routed packets.
