The tasks in the security role set a 600 second (10 minute) timeout for network
connections associated with a communication session. Deployers can change the
timeout value by setting the following Ansible variable:

.. code-block:: yaml

    # Example: shorten the timeout to 5 minutes (300 seconds)
    security_rhel7_session_timeout: 300
