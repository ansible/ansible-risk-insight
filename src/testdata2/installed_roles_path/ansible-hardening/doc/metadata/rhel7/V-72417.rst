The STIG requires that the following multifactor authentication packages are
installed:

* authconfig
* authconfig-gtk
* esc
* pam_pkcs11

These packages are benign if they are not needed on a system, but
``authconfig-gtk`` may cause some graphical dependencies to be installed
which may not be needed on some systems.  The security role installs these
packages, but it skips the installation of ``authconfig-gtk``. Deployers can
install the graphical package manually if needed.
