Searching an entire filesystem with ``find`` reduces system performance and
might impact certain applications negatively. Therefore, the search for files
and directories with an invalid group owner is **disabled by default**.

Deployers can opt in for this search by setting the following Ansible variable:

.. code-block:: yaml

    security_search_for_invalid_group_owner: yes

Any files or directories without a valid group owner are displayed in the
Ansible output.
