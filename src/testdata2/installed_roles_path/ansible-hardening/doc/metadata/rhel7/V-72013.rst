The ``CREATE_HOME`` variable is set to ``yes`` by the tasks in the security
role. This ensures that home directories are created each time a new user
account is created.

Deployers can opt out of this change by setting the following Ansible variable:

.. code-block:: yaml

    security_shadow_utils_create_home: no

.. note::

    On CentOS 7, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 systems, openSUSE Leap and SUSE
    Linux Enterprise 12, home directories are always created with new users by default.
    Home directories are not created by default on Ubuntu systems.
