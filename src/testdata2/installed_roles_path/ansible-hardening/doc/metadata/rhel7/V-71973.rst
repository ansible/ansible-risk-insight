Initializing the AIDE database and completing the first AIDE run causes
increased disk I/O and CPU usage for extended periods. Therefore, the AIDE
database is not automatically initialized by the tasks in the security role.

Deployers can enable the AIDE database initialization within the security role
by setting the following Ansible variable:

.. code-block:: yaml

    security_rhel7_initialize_aide: yes
