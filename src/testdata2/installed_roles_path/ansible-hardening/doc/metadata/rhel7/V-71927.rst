Setting a minimum password lifetime on interactive user accounts provides
security benefits by limiting the frequency of password changes. However, this
can cause login problems for users without proper communication and
coordination.

Deployers can opt-in for this change by setting the following Ansible variable:

.. code-block:: yaml

    security_set_minimum_password_lifetime: yes

The tasks will examine each interactive user account and set the minimum
password age if the existing setting is not equal to one day.
