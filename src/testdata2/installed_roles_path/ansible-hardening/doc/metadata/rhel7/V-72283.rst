The tasks in this role set ``net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_source_route`` and
``net.ipv4.conf.default.accept_source_route`` to ``0`` by default. This
prevents the system from forwarding source-routed IPv4 packets on all
new and existing interfaces.

Deployers can opt out of this change by setting the following Ansible variable:

.. code-block:: yaml

    security_disallow_source_routed_packet_forward_ipv4: no

For more details on source routed packets, refer to the
`Red Hat documentation <https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/6/html/Security_Guide/sect-Security_Guide-Server_Security-Disable-Source-Routing.html>`_.
