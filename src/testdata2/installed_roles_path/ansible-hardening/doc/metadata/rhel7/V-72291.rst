The tasks in this role set ``net.ipv4.conf.default.send_redirects`` and
``net.ipv4.conf.all.send_redirects`` to ``0`` by default. This prevents a
system from sending IPv4 ICMP redirect packets on all new and existing
interfaces.

Deployers can opt out of this change by setting the following Ansible variable:

.. code-block:: yaml

    security_disallow_icmp_redirects: no
