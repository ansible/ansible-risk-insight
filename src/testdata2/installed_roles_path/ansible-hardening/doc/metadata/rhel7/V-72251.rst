The ``Protocol`` configuration is set to ``2`` in
``/etc/ssh/sshd_config`` and sshd is restarted.

Deployers can opt out of this change by setting the following Ansible variable:

.. code-block:: yaml

    security_sshd_protocol: 2

.. warning::

    There is no reason to enable any other protocol than SSHv2. SSHv1 has
    multiple vulnerabilities, and it is no longer widely used.
