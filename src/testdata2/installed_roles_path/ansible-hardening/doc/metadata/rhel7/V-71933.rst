Although the STIG requires that five passwords are remembered to prevent re-
use, this can cause issues in production environment if the change is not
communicated well to users. Therefore, the tasks in the security role do not
apply this change by default.

Deployers can opt in for the change and specify a number of passwords to
remember by setting the following Ansible variable:

.. code-block:: yaml

    security_password_remember_password: 5
