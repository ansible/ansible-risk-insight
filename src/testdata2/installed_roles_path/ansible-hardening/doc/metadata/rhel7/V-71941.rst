The STIG requires that user accounts are disabled when their password expires.
This might be disruptive for some users or for automated processes. Therefore,
the tasks in the security role do not apply this change by default.

Deployers can opt in for this change by setting the following Ansible variable:

.. code-block:: yaml

    security_disable_account_if_password_expires: yes
