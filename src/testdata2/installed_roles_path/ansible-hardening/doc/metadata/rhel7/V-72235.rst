The STIG has a requirement that the ``sshd`` daemon is running and enabled at
boot time. The tasks in the security role ensure that these requirements are
met.

Some deployers may not have ``sshd`` enabled on highly specialized systems and
those deployers should opt out of this change by setting the following Ansible
variable:

.. code-block:: yaml

    security_enable_sshd: no

.. note::

    Setting ``security_enable_sshd`` to ``no`` causes the tasks to ignore the
    state of the service entirely. A setting of ``no`` does not stop or alter
    the ``sshd`` service.
