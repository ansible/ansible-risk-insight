If an account with UID 0 other than ``root`` exists on the system, the playbook
will fail with an error message that includes the other accounts which have a
UID of 0.

Deployers are strongly urged to keep only one account with UID 0, ``root``, and
to use ``sudo`` any situations where root access is required.
