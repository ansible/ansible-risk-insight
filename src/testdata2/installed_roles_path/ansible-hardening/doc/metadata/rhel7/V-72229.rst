Deployers are strongly urged to utilize ``sssd`` for systems that authenticate
against LDAP or Active Directory (AD) servers.

To meet this control, deployers must ensure that ``ldap_tls_cacert`` or
``ldap_tls_cacertdir`` are set in the ``/etc/sssd/sssd.conf`` file. The
``ldap_tls_cacert`` directive specifies a single certificate while
``ldap_tls_cacertdir`` specifies a directory where ``sssd`` can find CA
certificates.

.. warning::

    Use caution when adjusting these settings. If the correct CA certificates
    are not already deployed to the servers that perform LDAP authentication,
    their attempts to authenticate users might fail.

    Consult with administrators of the LDAP system and test all changes on
    a non-production system first.
