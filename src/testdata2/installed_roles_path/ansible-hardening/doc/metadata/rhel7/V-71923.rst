The role ensures that ``crypt_style`` is set to ``sha512`` in
``/etc/libuser.conf``, which is the default for CentOS 7 and Red Hat Enterprise
Linux 7.

Ubuntu, openSUSE and SUSE Linux Enterprise 12 do not use ``libuser``, so this change
is not applicable.

Deployers can opt out of this change by setting the following Ansible variable:

.. code-block:: yaml

    security_libuser_crypt_style_sha512: no
