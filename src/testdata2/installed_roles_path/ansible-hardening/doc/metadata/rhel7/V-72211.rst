Deployers must take manual steps to add or remove syslog reception
configuration lines depending on a server's role:

* If the server is a log aggregation server, deployers must configure the
  server to receive syslog output from the other servers via TCP connections.

* If the server is not a log aggregation server, deployers must configure the
  server so that it does not accept syslog output from other servers.
