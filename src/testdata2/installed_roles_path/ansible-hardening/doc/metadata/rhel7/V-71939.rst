The ``PermitEmptyPasswords`` configuration will be set to ``no`` in
``/etc/ssh/sshd_config`` and sshd will be restarted. This disallows logins over
ssh for users with a empty or null password set.

Deployers can opt-out of this change by setting the following Ansible variable:

.. code-block:: yaml

    security_sshd_disallow_empty_password: no
