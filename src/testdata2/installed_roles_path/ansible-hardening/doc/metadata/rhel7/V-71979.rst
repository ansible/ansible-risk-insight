On Ubuntu systems, the tasks comment out the ``no-debsig`` configuration line
in ``/etc/dpkg/dpkg.cfg``. This causes ``dpkg`` to verify GPG signatures for
all packages that are installed locally.

On CentOS 7 systems, the tasks set the ``localpkg_gpgcheck`` option to ``1`` in
the ``/etc/yum.conf`` file. This enables GPG checks for all packages installed
locally with ``yum``.

On openSUSE Leap systems, the tasks set the ``gpgcheck`` option to ``1`` in the
``/etc/zypp/zypp.conf`` file. This enables GPG checks for all packages installed
with ``zypper``.

Setting ``security_enable_gpgcheck_packages_local`` to ``no`` will skip the
``no-debsig`` adjustment on Ubuntu and it will set ``local_gpgcheck=0`` in
``/etc/yum.conf`` on CentOS systems. Similarly, on openSUSE Leap systems, it will set
``gpgcheck=0`` in ``/etc/zypp/zypp.conf``.
