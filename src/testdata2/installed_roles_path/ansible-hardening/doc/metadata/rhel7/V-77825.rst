Most modern systems enable Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) by
default (with a setting of ``2``), and the role ensures that the secure
default is maintained.

Deployers can opt out of the change by setting the following Ansible variable:

.. code-block:: yaml

    security_enable_aslr: no

For more details on the ASLR settings, review the
`sysctl documentation <https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/sysctl/kernel.txt>`_.
