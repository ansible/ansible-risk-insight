The STIG requires that the screensaver appears when a session reaches a certain
period of inactivity. The tasks will enable the screensaver for inactive
sessions by default.

Deployers can opt out of this change by setting an Ansible variable:

.. code-block:: yaml

    security_lock_session_when_inactive: no
