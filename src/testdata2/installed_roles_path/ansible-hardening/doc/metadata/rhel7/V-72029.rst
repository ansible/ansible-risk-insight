Although the STIG requires that all initialization files for interactive users
have proper owners, group owners, and permissions, these changes are often
disruptive for users. The tasks in the security role do not make any changes
to user initialization files.

Deployers should review the content and discretionary access controls applied
to each user's initialization files in their home directory.
