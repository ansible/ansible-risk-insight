Although the STIG requires that a maximum password lifetime is set for all
interactive user accounts, the security benefits of this configuration are
debatable. The `draft of NIST Publication 800-63B`_ argues that password
rotation may reduce overall security in some situations.

Deployers can opt-in for this change by setting the following Ansible variable:

.. code-block:: yaml

    security_set_maximum_password_lifetime: yes

The tasks will examine each interactive user account and set the maximum
password age if the existing setting is not equal to 60 days.
