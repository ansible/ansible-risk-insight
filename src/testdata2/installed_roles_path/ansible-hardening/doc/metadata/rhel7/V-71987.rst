Although the STIG requires that dependent packages are removed automatically
when a package is removed, this can cause problems with certain packages,
especially kernels. Deployers must opt in to meet the requirements of this STIG
control.

Deployers should set the following variable to enable automatic dependent
package removal:

.. code-block:: yaml

    security_package_clean_on_remove: yes
