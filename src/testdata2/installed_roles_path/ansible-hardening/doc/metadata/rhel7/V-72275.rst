The PAM configuration is checked for the presence of ``pam_lastlogin`` and a
warning message is printed if the directive is not found. The tasks in the
security role do not adjust PAM configurations since these changes might be
disruptive in some environments.

Deployers should review their PAM configurations and add ``pam_lastlogin`` to
``/etc/pam.d/postlogin`` on CentOS and Red Hat Enterprise Linux or to
``/etc/pam.d/login`` on Ubuntu, openSUSE Leap and SUSE Linux Enterprise.
