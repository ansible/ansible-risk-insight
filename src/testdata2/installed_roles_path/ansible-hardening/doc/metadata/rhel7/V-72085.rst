The ``audispd`` daemon transmits audit logs without encryption by default. The
STIG requires that these logs are encrypted while they are transferred across
the network. The encryption is controlled by the ``enable_krb5`` option in
``/etc/audisp/audisp-remote.conf``.

Deployers can opt-in for encrypted audit log transmission by setting the
following Ansible variable:

.. code-block:: yaml

    security_audisp_enable_krb5: yes

.. warning::

    Only enable this setting if kerberos is already configured.
