The ``Compression`` configuration is set to ``delayed`` in
``/etc/ssh/sshd_config`` and sshd is restarted.

Deployers can choose another option by setting the following Ansible variable:

.. code-block:: yaml

    security_sshd_compression: 'no'

.. note::

    The following are the available settings for ``Compression`` in the ssh
    configuration file:

    * ``delayed``: Compression is enabled after authentication.
    * ``no``: Compression is disabled.
    * ``yes``: Compression is enabled during authentication and during the
      session (not allowed by the STIG).

    The ``delayed`` option balances security with performance and is an
    approved option in the STIG.
