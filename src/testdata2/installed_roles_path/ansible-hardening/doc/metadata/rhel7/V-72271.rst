Although the STIG requires that incoming TCP connections are rate limited with
``firewalld``, this setting can cause problems with certain applications which
handle large amounts of TCP connections. Therefore, the tasks in the security
role do not apply the rate limit by default.

Deployers can opt in for this change by setting the following Ansible variable:

.. code-block:: yaml

    security_enable_firewalld_rate_limit: yes

The STIG recommends a limit of 25 connection per minute and allowing bursts up
to 100 connections. Both of these options are adjustable with the following
Ansible variables:

.. code-block:: yaml

    security_enable_firewalld_rate_limit_per_minute: 25
    security_enable_firewalld_rate_limit_burst: 100

.. warning::

    Deployers should test rate limiting in a non-production environment first
    before applying it to production systems. Ensure that the application
    running on the system is receiving a large volume of requests so that the
    rule can be thoroughly tested.
