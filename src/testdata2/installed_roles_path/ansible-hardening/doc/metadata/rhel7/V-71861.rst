The security role configures a login banner for graphical logins using
``dconf``. Deployers can opt out of this change by setting the following
Ansible variable:

.. code-block:: yaml

    security_enable_graphical_login_message: no

The message is customized by setting another Ansible variable:

.. code-block:: yaml

    security_enable_graphical_login_message_text: >
        You are accessing a secured system and your actions will be logged along
        with identifying information. Disconnect immediately if you are not an
        authorized user of this system.

.. note::

    The space available for the graphical banner is relatively short. Deployers
    should limit the length of their graphical login banners to the shortest
    length possible.
