The ``UsePrivilegeSeparation`` configuration is set to ``sandbox`` in
``/etc/ssh/sshd_config`` and sshd is restarted.

Deployers can opt out of this change by setting the following Ansible variable:

.. code-block:: yaml

    security_sshd_enable_privilege_separation: no

.. note::

    Although the STIG requires this setting to be ``yes``, the ``sandbox``
    setting actually provides more security because it enables privilege
    separation during the early authentication process.
