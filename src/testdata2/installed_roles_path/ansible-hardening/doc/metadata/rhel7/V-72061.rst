Deployers should consider using filesystem mounts for ``/var`` during
the initial server provisioning process. Adding filesystem mounts after a
system is provisioned might lead to downtime.

The tasks in the security role do not take action on filesystem mounts. If the
server does not mount ``/var`` as a separate filesystem, a warning is printed
in the Ansible output.
