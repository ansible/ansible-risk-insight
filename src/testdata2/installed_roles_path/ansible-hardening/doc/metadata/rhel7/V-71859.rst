The tasks in the security role configure ``dconf`` to display a login banner
each time a graphical session starts on the system. The default banner message
set by the role is:

    You are accessing a secured system and your actions will be logged along
    with identifying information. Disconnect immediately if you are not an
    authorized user of this system.

Deployers can customize this message by setting an Ansible variable:

.. code-block:: yaml

    security_enable_graphical_login_message_text: >
        This is a customized banner message.

.. warning::

    The dconf configuration does not support multi-line strings. Ensure that
    ``security_enable_graphical_login_message_text`` contains a single line
    of text.

In addition, deployers can opt out of displaying a login banner message by
changing ``security_enable_graphical_login_message`` to ``no``.
