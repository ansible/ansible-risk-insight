This STIG is difficult to implement in an automated way because the number of
applications on a system with setuid/setgid permissions changes over time.
In addition, adding audit rules for some of these automatically could cause a
significant increase in logging traffic when these applications are used
regularly.

Deployers are urged to do the following instead:

* Minimize the amount of applications with setuid/setgid privileges
* Monitor any new applications that gain setuid/setgid privileges
* Add risky applications with setuid/setgid privileges to auditd for detailed
  syscall monitoring
