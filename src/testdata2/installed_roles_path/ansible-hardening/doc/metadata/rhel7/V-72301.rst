The role will remove the TFTP server package from the system if it is
installed. The package name differs between Linux distributions:

* CentOS: ``tftp-server``
* Ubuntu: ``tftpd``
* openSUSE Leap: ``tftp``

Deployers can opt-out of this change by setting the following Ansible variable:


.. code-block:: yaml

    security_rhel7_remove_tftp_server: no
