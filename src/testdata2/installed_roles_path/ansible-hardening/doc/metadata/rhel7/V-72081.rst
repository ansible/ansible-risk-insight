The audit daemon takes various actions when there is an auditing failure. There
are three options for the ``-f`` flag for ``auditctl``:

* ``0``: In the event of an auditing failure, do nothing.
* ``1``: In the event of an auditing failure, write messages to the kernel log.
* ``2``: In the event of an auditing failure, cause a kernel panic.

Most operating systems set the failure flag to ``1`` by default, which
maximizes system availability while still causing an alert. The tasks in the
security role set the flag to ``1`` by default.

Deployers can adjust the following Ansible variable to customize the failure
flag:

.. code-block:: yaml

    security_rhel7_audit_failure_flag: 1

.. warning::

    Setting the failure flag to ``2`` is **strongly** discouraged unless the
    security of the system takes priority over its availability. Any failure in
    auditing causes a kernel panic and the system requires a hard reboot.
