If ``AutomaticLoginEnable=true`` exists in the gdm configuration file,
``/etc/gdm/custom.conf``, the configuration will removed. This disallows
automatic logins for gdm and requires a user to complete the username and
password prompts.

Deployers can opt-out of this change by setting an Ansible variable:

.. code-block:: yaml

    security_disable_gdm_automatic_login: no
