Although the STIG requires that each account is limited to 10 concurrent
connections, this change might be disruptive in some environments. Therefore,
this change is not applied by default.

Deployers can opt in for this change by setting a concurrent connection limit
with this Ansible variable:

.. code-block:: yaml

    security_rhel7_concurrent_session_limit: 10
