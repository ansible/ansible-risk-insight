The ``space_left_action`` in the audit daemon configuration is set to
``email``. This configuration causes the root user to receive an email when the
``space_left`` threshold is reached.

Deployers can customize this configuration by setting the following Ansible
variable:

.. code-block:: yaml

    security_rhel7_auditd_space_left_action: email
