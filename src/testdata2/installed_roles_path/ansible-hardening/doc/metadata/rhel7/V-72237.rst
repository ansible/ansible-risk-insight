The ``ClientAliveInterval`` configuration is set to ``600`` in
``/etc/ssh/sshd_config`` and sshd is restarted.

Deployers can adjust the length of the interval by changing the following
Ansible variable:

.. code-block:: yaml

    security_sshd_client_alive_interval: 600

.. note::

    The STIG requires that ``ClientAliveInterval`` is set to 600 and
    ``ClientAliveCountMax`` is set to zero, which sets a 10 minute session
    timeout. If no data is transferred in a 10 minute period, the session is
    disconnected.

    The ``ClientAliveInterval`` specifies how long the ssh daemon waits
    before it sends a message to the client to see if it is still alive. The
    ``ClientAliveCountMax`` specifies how many of these messages are sent
    without receiving a response.

    Deployers should refer to :ref:`stig-V-72241` to customize the
    ``ClientAliveCountMax`` setting.
