On Ubuntu systems, the tasks check for the ``AllowUnauthenticated`` string
anywhere in the apt configuration files found within ``/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/``.
If the string is found, a warning is printed on the console.

On CentOS 7 systems, the tasks set the ``gpgcheck`` option to ``1`` in the
``/etc/yum.conf`` file. This enables GPG checks for all packages installed
with ``yum``.

On openSUSE Leap systems, the tasks set the ``gpgcheck`` option to ``1`` in the
``/etc/zypp/zypp.conf`` file. This enables GPG checks for all packages installed
with ``zypper``.

Setting ``security_enable_gpgcheck_packages`` to ``no`` will skip the
``AllowUnauthenticated`` string check on Ubuntu and it will set ``gpgcheck=0``
in ``/etc/yum.conf`` or ``/etc/zypp/zypp.conf`` on CentOS and openSUSE Leap systems
respectively.
