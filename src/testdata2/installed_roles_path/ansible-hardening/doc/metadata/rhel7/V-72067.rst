The tasks in the Ansible role install the ``dracut-fips`` (RHEL and SLE) and
``dracut-fips-aesni`` (RHEL) packages and check to see if FIPS is enabled on the
system. If it is not enabled, a warning message is printed in the Ansible
output.

Enabling FIPS at boot time requires additional manual configuration. Refer to
`Chapter 7. Federal Standards and Regulations`_ in the Red Hat documentation
for more details. Section 7.1.1 contains the steps required for updating
the bootloader configuration and regenerating the initramfs.

.. note::

    This change only applies to CentOS, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, openSUSE Leap
    and SUSE Linux Enterprise. Ubuntu does not use dracut by default and the process
    for enabling the FIPS functionality at boot time is more complex.
