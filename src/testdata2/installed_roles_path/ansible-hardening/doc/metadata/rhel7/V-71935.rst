Although the STIG requires that passwords have a minimum length of 15
characters, this change might be disruptive to users on a production system
without communicating the change first. Therefore, this change is not applied
by default.

Deployers can opt in for the change by setting the following Ansible variable:

.. code-block:: yaml

    security_pwquality_require_minimum_password_length: yes
