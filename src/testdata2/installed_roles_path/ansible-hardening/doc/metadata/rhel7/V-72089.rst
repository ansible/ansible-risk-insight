The ``space_left`` configuration is set to 25% of the size of the disk mounted
on ``/``.  This calculation is done automatically.

Deployers can set a custom threshold for the ``space_left`` configuration (in
megabytes) by setting the following Ansible variable:

.. code-block:: yaml

    # Example: A setting of 1GB (1024MB)
    security_rhel7_auditd_space_left: 1024
