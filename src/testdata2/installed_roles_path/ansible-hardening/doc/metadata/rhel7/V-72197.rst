The tasks add a rule to auditd that logs each time that an account is modified.
This includes changes to the following files:

* ``/etc/group``
* ``/etc/passwd``
* ``/etc/gshadow``
* ``/etc/shadow``
* ``/etc/security/opasswd``

Deployers can opt-out of this change by setting an Ansible variable:

.. code-block:: yaml

    security_rhel7_audit_account_actions: no
