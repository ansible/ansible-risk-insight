Deployers are strongly urged to utilize ``sssd`` for systems that authenticate
against LDAP or Active Directory (AD) servers.

The ldap connector for ``sssd`` connects only to LDAP servers over
encrypted connections. Review the man page for
`sssd-ldap <https://linux.die.net/man/5/sssd-ldap>`_ for more details on this
requirement.
