The ``PermitRootLogin`` configuration is set to ``no`` in
``/etc/ssh/sshd_config`` and sshd is restarted.

Deployers can select another setting for PermitRootLogin, from the available
options ``without-password``, ``prohibit-password``, ``forced-commands-only``,
``yes``, or ``no`` by setting the following variable:

.. code-block:: yaml

    security_sshd_permit_root_login: no

.. warning::

    Ensure that a regular user account exists with a pathway to root access
    (preferably via ``sudo``) before applying the security role. This
    configuration change disallows any direct logins with the ``root``
    user.
