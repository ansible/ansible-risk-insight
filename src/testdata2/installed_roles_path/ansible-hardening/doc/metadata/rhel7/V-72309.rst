Disabling IP forwarding on a system that routes packets or host virtual
machines might cause network interruptions. The tasks in this role do not
adjust the ``net.ipv4.ip_forward`` configuration by default.

Deployers can opt in for this change and disable IP forwarding by setting the
following Ansible variable:

.. code-block:: yaml

    security_disallow_ip_forwarding: yes

.. warning::

    IP forwarding is required in some environments. Always test in a
    non-production environment before changing this setting on a production
    system.
