Although the STIG requires that all passwords have a minimum lifetime set, this
can cause issue in some production environments. Therefore, deployers must opt
in for this change.

Set the following Ansible variable to an integer (in days) to enable this
setting:

.. code-block:: yaml

    security_password_min_lifetime_days: 1

The STIG requires the minimum lifetime for password to be one day.
