Although the STIG requires that all local interactive user accounts have a
umask of ``077``, this change can be disruptive for users and the applications
they run. This change cannot be applied in an automated way.

Deployers should review user initialization files regularly to ensure that the
umask is not specified. This allows the system-wide setting of ``077`` to be
applied to all user sessions.
