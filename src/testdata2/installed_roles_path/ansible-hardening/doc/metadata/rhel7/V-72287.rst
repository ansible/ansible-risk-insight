The tasks in this role set ``net.ipv4.icmp_echo_ignore_broadcasts`` to ``1``
by default. This prevents the system from responding to IPv4 ICMP echoes sent
to the broadcast address.

Deployers can opt out of this change by setting the following Ansible variable:

.. code-block:: yaml

    security_disallow_echoes_broadcast_address: no
