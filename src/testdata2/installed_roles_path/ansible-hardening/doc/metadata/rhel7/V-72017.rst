Although the STIG requires that all home directories have the proper owner,
group owner, and permissions, these changes might be disruptive in some
environments. These tasks are not executed by default.

Deployers can opt in for the following changes to each home directory:

* Permissions are set to ``0750`` at a maximum. If permissions are already
  more restrictive than ``0750``, the permissions are left unchanged.

* User ownership is set to the ``UID`` of the user.

* Group ownership is set to the ``GID`` of the user.

Deployers can opt in for these changes by setting the following Ansible
variable:

.. code-block:: yaml

    security_set_home_directory_permissions_and_owners: yes
