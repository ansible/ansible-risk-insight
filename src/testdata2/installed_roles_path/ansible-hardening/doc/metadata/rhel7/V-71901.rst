The STIG requires that a graphical session is locked when the screensaver
starts. This requires a user to re-enter their credentials to regain access to
the system.

The tasks will set a timeout of 5 seconds after the screensaver has started
before the session is locked. This gives a user a few seconds to press a key or
wiggle their mouse after the screensaver appears without needing to re-enter
their credentials.

Deployers can adjust this timeout by setting an Ansible variable:

.. code-block:: yaml

    security_lock_session_screensaver_lock_delay: 5
