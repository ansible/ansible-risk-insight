The STIG requires that graphical sessions are locked when the screensaver
starts and that users must re-enter credentials to restore access to the
system. The screensaver lock is enabled by default if ``dconf`` is present on
the system.

Deployers can opt out of this change by setting an Ansible variable:

.. code-block:: yaml

    security_lock_session: no
