The tasks in the security role set the ``disk_full_action`` and
``network_failure_action`` to ``syslog`` in the audispd remote configuration.
In the event of a full disk on the remote log server or a network interruption,
the local system sends warnings to syslog. This is the safest option since it
maximizes the availability of the local system.

Deployers have two other options available:

* ``single``: Switch the local server into single-user mode in the event of a
  logging failure.

* ``halt``: Shut off the local server gracefully in the event of a logging
  failure.

.. warning::

    Choosing ``single`` or ``halt`` causes a server to go into a degraded or
    offline state immediately after a logging failure.

Deployers can adjust these configurations by setting the following Ansible
variables (the safe defaults are shown here):

.. code-block:: yaml

    security_rhel7_auditd_disk_full_action: syslog
    security_rhel7_auditd_network_failure_action: syslog
