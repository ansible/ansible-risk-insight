The tasks in the security role examine the SELinux contexts on each device file
found on the system. Any devices without appropriate labels are printed in
the Ansible output.

Deployers should investigate the unlabeled devices and ensure that the correct
labels are applied for the class of device.

.. note::

    This change applies only to CentOS or Red Hat Enterprise Linux systems
    since they rely on SELinux as their default Linux Security Module (LSM).
    Ubuntu, openSUSE Leap and SUSE Linux Enterprise systems use AppArmor, which
    uses policy files rather than labels applied to individual files.
