By default, CentOS 7, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, openSUSE Leap and SUSE Linux
Enterprise 12 check for virus database updates 12 times a day. Ubuntu servers
have a default of 24 checks per day.

The tasks in the security role do not adjust these defaults as they are more
secure than the STIG's requirement.
