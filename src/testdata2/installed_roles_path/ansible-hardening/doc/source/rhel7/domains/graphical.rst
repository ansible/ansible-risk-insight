graphical - Graphical login security controls
=============================================

Although most Linux servers only have text-based interfaces, graphical
environments are required for certain applications. Security controls must be
applied to these graphical environments to prevent unauthorized access.

Overview
--------

The STIG requirements for graphical interfaces are focused on ensuring proper
authentication for new sessions and enforcing re-authentication after idle
periods.

These controls will be skipped on systems without a graphical login interface.
