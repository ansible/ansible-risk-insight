auth - Authentication
=====================

User or automated authentication to a Linux system must be closely monitored
and carefully configured to prevent unauthorized access.

Overview
--------

Most of the STIG requirements for authentication are already included in Linux
distributions by default or are easily applied without disruptions. Deployers
should review the documentation below and test all changes on a non-production
system first.
