features:
  - |
    The service setup in keystone for tempest will now be executed
    through delegation to the ``tempest_service_setup_host`` which,
    by default, is ``localhost`` (the deploy host). Deployers can
    opt to rather change this to the utility container by implementing
    the following override in ``user_variables.yml``.

    .. code-block:: yaml

      tempest_service_setup_host: "{{ groups['utility_all'][0] }}"
  - |
    Rather than a hard-coded set of projects and users, tempest can
    now be configured with a custom list with the variables
    ``tempest_projects`` and ``tempest_users``.

deprecations:
  - |
    The variable ``tempest_requires_pip_packages`` is no longer required
    and has therefore been removed.
  - |
    The variable ``tempest_image_downloader`` has been removed. The image
    download now uses the same host designated by the
    ``tempest_service_setup_host`` for the image download.
