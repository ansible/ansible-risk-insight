    Python-tempestconf is a tool that generates a tempest.conf file, based
    only on the credentials from an openstack installation. It uses the
    discoverable api from openstack to check for services, features, etc.

    Add the possibility to use python-tempestconf tool to generate tempest.conf
    file, rather than use the role template.
