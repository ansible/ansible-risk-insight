features:
  - Within the lxc-container-create role the legacy networking scripts have been
    converted to use systemd-networkd for ubuntu and centos. This gives us a
    single, common, networking functionality to across multiple distros.
  - All of the pre/post up, and pre/post down adhoc command options have been
    converted to using systemd "oneshot" services. This conversion allows all
    supported distros to benefit from the ability to run adhoc commands before
    and after networking is available on both start-up and shut-down.
