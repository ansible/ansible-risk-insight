fixes:
  - |
    When using LXC containers with a copy-on-write back-end, the ``lxc_hosts``
    role execution would fail due to undefined variables with the
    ``nspawn_host_`` prefix. This issue has now been fixed.
deprecations:
  - |
    The following variable name changes have been implemented in order to
    better reflect their purpose.

    * ``lxc_host_machine_quota_disabled`` -> ``lxc_host_btrfs_quota_disabled``
    * ``lxc_host_machine_qgroup_space_limit`` -> ``lxc_host_btrfs_qgroup_space_limit``
    * ``lxc_host_machine_qgroup_compression_limit`` -> ``lxc_host_btrfs_qgroup_compression_limit``
