features:
  - LXC containers will now generate a fixed mac address on all
    network interfaces when the option `lxc_container_fixed_mac`
    is set to **true**. This feature was implemented to resolve
    issues with dynamic mac addresses in containers generally
    experienced at scale with network intensive services.
fixes:
  - LXC containers will now have the ability to use a fixed mac
    address on all network interfaces when the option
    `lxc_container_fixed_mac` is set **true**. This change will
    assist in resolving a long standing issue where network intensive
    services, such as neutron and rabbitmq, can enter a confused state
    for long periods of time and require rolling restarts or internal
    system resets to recover.
