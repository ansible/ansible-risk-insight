features:
  - The ``lxc_container_create`` role will now build a container
    based on the distro of the host OS.
  - The ``lxc_container_create`` role now supports Ubuntu 14.04,
    16.04, and RHEL/CentOS 7
upgrade:
  - The ``lxc_container_create`` role no longer uses the distro specific lxc
    container create template.
  - |
    The following variable changes have been made in the  ``lxc_host`` role:

    * **lxc_container_template**: Removed because the template option is now
      contained within the operating system specific variable file loaded at
      runtime.
    * **lxc_container_template_options**: This option was renamed to
      *lxc_container_download_template_options*. The deprecation filter was not
      used because the values provided from this option have been
      fundamentally changed and old overrides will cause problems.
    * **lxc_container_release**: Removed because image is now tied with the host
      operating system.
    * **lxc_container_user_name**: Removed because the default users are no longer
      created when the cached image is created.
    * **lxc_container_user_password**: Removed because the default users are no
      longer created when the cached image is created.
    * **lxc_container_template_main_apt_repo**: Removed because this option is now
      being set within the cache creation process and is no longer needed here.
    * **lxc_container_template_security_apt_repo**: Removed because this option is
      now being set within the cache creation process and is no longer needed here.
