  - The ``lxc-container-create`` role now consumes the variable
    ``lxc_container_commands`` which should contain any shell commands that
    should be executed in a newly created container. This feature is designed
    to be used in group_vars to ensure that containers are fully prepared
    at the time they are created, thus cutting down the number of times
    containers are restarted during deployments and upgrades.
