  - The ``lxc-container-create`` role now consumes the variable
    ``lxc_container_bind_mounts`` which should contain a list
    of bind mounts to apply to a newly created container. The
    appropriate host and container directory will be created and
    the configuration applied to the container config. This
    feature is designed to be used in group_vars to ensure that
    containers are fully prepared at the time they are created,
    thus cutting down the number of times containers are restarted
    during deployments and upgrades.
