features:
  - The tag options when creating an LXC container have been simplified. The two
    tags now supported by the `lxc_container_create` role are
    **lxc-{create,config}**.
upgrade:
  - The LXC container create option `lxc_container_backing_store` is now defined
    by default and has a value of "dir". Prior to this release the backend store
    option was using several auto-detection methods to try and guess the store
    type based on facts fed into the role and derived from the physical host.
    While the auto-detection methods worked, they created a cumbersome set of
    conditionals and limited our ability to leverage additional container
    stores. Having this option be a default allows deployers to mix and match
    container stores to suit the needs of the deployment. Existing deployments
    should set this option within group or user variables to ensure
    there's no change in the backend store when new container be provisioned.
other:
  - The LXC container create role will now check for the LXC volume group if
    the option `lxc_container_backing_store` is set to "lvm". If this volume
    group is not found, the role will halt and instruct the deployer to update
    their configuration options and inspect their host setup.
