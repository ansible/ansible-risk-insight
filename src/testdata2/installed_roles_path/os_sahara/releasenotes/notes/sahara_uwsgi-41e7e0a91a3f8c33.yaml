features:
  - The ``sahara-api`` service has moved to run as a
    uWSGI application. You can set the max number of
    WSGI processes, the number of processes, threads,
    and buffer size utilizing the
    ``sahara_wsgi_processes_max``,
    ``sahara_wsgi_processes``, ``sahara_wsgi_threads``,
    and ``sahara_wsgi_buffer_size``.
    Additionally, you can override any settings in the
    uWSGI ini configuration file using the
    ``sahara_api_uwsgi_ini_overrides`` setting.
    The uWSGI application will listen on the address
    specified by ``sahara_uwsgi_bind_address`` which
    defaults to ``0.0.0.0``.
