features:
  - |
    The service setup in keystone for octavia will now be executed
    through delegation to the ``octavia_service_setup_host`` which,
    by default, is ``localhost`` (the deploy host). Deployers can
    opt to rather change this to the utility container by implementing
    the following override in ``user_variables.yml``.

    .. code-block:: yaml

      octavia_service_setup_host: "{{ groups['utility_all'][0] }}"

deprecations:
  - |
    The variable ``octavia_requires_pip_packages`` is no longer required
    and has therefore been removed.
  - |
    The variable ``octavia_image_downloader`` has been removed. The image
    download now uses the same host designated by the
    ``octavia_service_setup_host`` for the image download.
  - |
    The variable ``octavia_ansible_endpoint_type`` has been removed. The
    endpoint used for ansible tasks has been hard set to the 'admin'
    endpoint as is commonly used across all OSA roles.
