    This consolidates the amphora image tasks in a common file and adds a way
    to download an amphora image from an artefact storage over http(s). With
    the Octavia team providing test images the tests were modified to not
    build images any longer but download them.

    It is commonly considered bad practice to downlaod random images from the
    Internet expecially the test images the Octavia team provides which could
    potentially include unpatched operating system packages - so for any
    production deploy adjust the download url to an artifact storage your
    organization controls. The system also does not authenticate the image
    (e.g. with an md5) so should only be used on networks your organization
    controls.
