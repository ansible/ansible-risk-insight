features:
  - Adds a way for the system to automatically create the Octavia management
    network if octavia_service_net_setup is enabled (DEFAULT). Additional
    parameters can control the setup.
  - Adds support for glance-image-id and automatic uploading of the image
    if octavia_amp_image_upload_enabled is True (Default is False). This is
    mostly tp work around the limitations of Ansible's OpenStack support
    and should not be used in prodcution settings. Instead refer to the
    documentation to upload images yourself.
