    Added variable `horizon_policy_overrides` which allows to customize horizon
    specific policies. As we don't want to carry and maintain horizon policies
    with OSA, they're retrieved from horizon hosts and adjusted in-place,
    which means that they won't rollback in case you just remove override.
    `horizon_policy_overrides` has also non-standart format, as it's nested
    dictionary, where 1st level key represents service which policy needs to
    be overriden, and it's value is normal policy override format.
