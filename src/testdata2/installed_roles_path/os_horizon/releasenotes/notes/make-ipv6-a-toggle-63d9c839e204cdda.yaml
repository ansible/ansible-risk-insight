    Horizon's IPv6 support is now enabled by default. This allows users to
    manage subnets with IPv6 addresses within the Horizon interface. Deployers
    can disable IPv6 support in Horizon by setting the following variable:

    .. code-block:: yaml

        horizon_enable_ipv6: False

    Please note: Horizon will still display IPv6 addresses in various panels
    with IPv6 support disabled. However, it will not allow any direct
    management of IPv6 configuration.
