features:
  - The ``os_horizon`` role now supports distribution of user custom themes.
    Deployers can use the new key ``theme_src_archive`` of ``horizon_custom_themes``
    dictionary to provide absolute path to the archived theme.
    Only .tar.gz, .tgz, .zip, .tar.bz, .tar.bz2, .tbz, .tbz2 archives are supported.
    Structure inside archive should be as a standard theme, without any leading folders.
fixes:
  - Fixes bug https://bugs.launchpad.net/openstack-ansible/+bug/1778098 where playbook failed, if
    ``horizon_custom_themes`` is specified, and directory for theme is not provided
