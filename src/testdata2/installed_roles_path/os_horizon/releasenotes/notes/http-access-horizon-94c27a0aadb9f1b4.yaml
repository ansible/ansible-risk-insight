    Horizon has, since OSA's inception, been deployed with HTTPS
    access enabled, and has had no way to turn it off. Some use-cases
    may want to access via HTTP instead, so this patch enables
    the following.

    * Listen via HTTPS on a load balancer, but via HTTP on the
      horizon host and have the load balancer forward the correct
      headers. It will do this by default in the integrated build
      due to the presence of the load balancer, so the current
      behaviour is retained.

    * Enable HTTPS on the horizon host without a load balancer.
      This is the role's default behaviour which matches what it
      always has been.

    * Disable HTTPS entirely by setting ``haproxy_ssl: no`` (which
      will also disable https on haproxy. This setting is inherited
      by the new ``horizon_enable_ssl`` variable by default. This
      is a new option.
