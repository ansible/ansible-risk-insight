features:
  - Add ``horizon_allowed_hosts`` to be able to configure django ALLOWED_HOSTS.
    The default is still the same as it was but you can create a list of allowed
    hosts in ``/etc/openstack_deploy/user_variables.yml``. to set the correct
    value, see https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/settings/#allowed-hosts
    for more details.
