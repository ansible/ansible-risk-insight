features:
  - |
    The service setup in keystone for horizon will now be executed
    through delegation to the ``horizon_service_setup_host`` which,
    by default, is ``localhost`` (the deploy host). Deployers can
    opt to rather change this to the utility container by implementing
    the following override in ``user_variables.yml``.

    .. code-block:: yaml

      horizon_service_setup_host: "{{ groups['utility_all'][0] }}"

deprecations:
  - |
    The variable ``horizon_requires_pip_packages`` is no longer required
    and has therefore been removed.
