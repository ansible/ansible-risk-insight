features:
  - The ``os_keystone`` role will now (by default) source the
    ``keystone-paste.ini``, ``policy.json`` and ``sso_callback_template.html``
    templates from the service git source instead of from the role. It also
    now includes a facility where you can place your own templates in
    ``/etc/openstack_deploy/keystone`` (by default) and it will be
    deployed to the target host after being interpreted by the
    template engine.
