deprecations:
  - |
    For consistency reasons, the following variables were deprecated in favor of
    the new ones in a standardized format used in other repositories.
    ``keystone_database_pool_timeout`` -> ``keystone_db_pool_timeout``
    ``keystone_database_max_pool_size`` -> ``keystone_db_max_pool_size``
    ``keystone_database_idle_timeout`` -> ``keystone_db_connection_recycle_time``
    However, they will be supported until next Yoga release.

    ``keystone_database_min_pool_size`` was deprecated as it's deprecated in oslo.db
