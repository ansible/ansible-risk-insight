features:
  - Added support for using mod_auth_openidc instead of shibboleth as a
    service provider for supporting users who have a preference to use OIDC
    for federation. Mod_auth_openidc is the apache module that is recommended
    in the keystone documentation for implementing openidc.
    Added a variable to called apache_mod to keystone_sp, if left undefined
    shibboleth will continue to be installed by default provided keystone_sp is
    not empty. Mod_auth_openidc will not be installed unless it is spelled
    correctly, any misspellings will result in a shibboleth install.
    Note that installing shibboleth on Debian based metal distro deployments
    may break services that depend on libcurl4, as shib2 requires libcurl3,
    and they are unable to coexist. This can be resolved when there is a
    shib3 package available in a future release of Ubuntu/Debian.
    There is currently no support for simultaneous use of shibboleth2 and
    mod_auth_openidc.
