upgrade:
  - Keystone now uses uWSGI exclusively (instead of Apache with mod_wsgi)
    and has the web server acting as a reverse proxy. The default web
    server is now set to Nginx instead of Apache, but Apache will
    automatically used if federation is configured.
deprecations:
  - The variables ``keystone_apache_enabled`` and ``keystone_mod_wsgi_enabled``
    have been removed and replaced with a single variable ``keystone_web_server``
    to optionally set the web server used for keystone.
