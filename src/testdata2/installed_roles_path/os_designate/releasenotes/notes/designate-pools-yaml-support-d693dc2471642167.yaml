features:
  - The Designate pools.yaml file can now be generated via the
    designate_pools_yaml attribute, if desired. This allows users to populate
    the Designate DNS server configuration using attributes from other plays
    and obviates the need to manage the file outside of the Designate role.
upgrade:
  - The Designate pools.yaml file can now be generated via the
    designate_pools_yaml attribute, if desired. This ability is toggled by
    the designate_use_pools_yaml_attr attribute. In the future this behavior
    may become default and designate_pools_yaml may become a required variable.
