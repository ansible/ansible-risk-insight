    Support for the networking-baremetal mechanism driver and agent has been implemented.
    The ironic-neutron-agent is a neutron agent that populates the host to physical network
    mapping for baremetal nodes in neutron. Neutron uses this to calculate the segment to
    host mapping information. This feature may be enabled by adding ``ml2.baremetal``
    to the ``neutron_plugin_types`` list in ``/etc/openstack_deploy/user_variables.yml``.
