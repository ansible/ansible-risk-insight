    Open vSwitch driver support has been implemented. This includes the implementation of the
    appropriate Neutron configuration and package installation. This feature may be activated
    by setting ``neutron_plugin_type: ml2.ovs`` in ``/etc/openstack_deploy/user_variables.yml``.
upgrade:
  - The variable ``neutron_linuxbridge`` has been removed as it is no longer used.

    ``neutron.conf`` is now determined based on the ``neutron_plugin_type``.
  - The variable ``neutron_driver_firewall`` has been removed. The appropriate value for
    ``neutron.conf`` is now determined based on the ``neutron_plugin_type``.
  - The variable ``neutron_ml2_mechanism_drivers`` has been removed. The appropriate value for
    ml2_conf.ini is now determined based on the ``neutron_plugin_type``.
