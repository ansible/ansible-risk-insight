upgrade:
  - The Neutron L3 Agent configuration for the handle_internal_only_routers
    variable is removed in order to use the Neutron upstream default setting.
    The current default for handle_internal_only_routers is True,
    which does allow Neutron L3 router without external networks attached
    (as discussed per https://bugs.launchpad.net/neutron/+bug/1572390).
