upgrade:
  - As described in the `Mitaka release notes
    <http://docs.openstack.org/releasenotes/neutron/mitaka.html>`_
    Neutron now correctly calculates for and advertises the MTU to
    instances. As such the ``neutron_network_device_mtu`` variable
    has been removed and the hard-coded values in the templates for
    ``advertise_mtu``, ``path_mtu``, and ``segment_mtu`` have been
    removed to allow upstream defaults to operate as intended.
