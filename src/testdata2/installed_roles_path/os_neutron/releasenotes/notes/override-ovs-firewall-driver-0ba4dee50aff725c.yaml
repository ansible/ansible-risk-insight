    Historically, Open vSwitch (OVS) could not interact directly with iptables
    to implement security groups. Thus, the OVS agent and Compute service use a
    Linux bridge between each instance (VM) and the OVS integration bridge
    br-int to implement security groups. Now the OVS agent includes an optional
    firewall driver that natively implements security groups as flows in OVS
    rather than the Linux bridge device and iptables. This increases
    scalability and performance.
features:
  - |
    You can override the default ``iptables_hybrid`` firewall driver for Open
    vSwitch by setting ``neutron_firewall_driver: openvswitch``
upgrade:
  - |
    Introduce this feature to empty compute nodes, and migrate VMs over once
    the agents have been restarted.
critical:
  - |
    This feature requires kernel and user space support for conntrack, thus
    requiring minimum versions of the Linux kernel and Open vSwitch. All cases
    require Open vSwitch version 2.5 or newer. Kernel version 4.3 or newer
    includes conntrack support. Kernel version 3.3, but less than 4.3, does not
    include conntrack support and requires building the OVS modules.
