    The ``provider_networks`` library has been updated to support the
    definition of bond member interfaces that can automatically be added as
    bond ports to OVS provider bridges setup during a deployment. This
    feature is currently limited to DPDK-based deployments. To activate this
    feature, add the ``network_bond_interfaces`` key to the respective provider
    network definition in ``openstack_user_config.yml``. For more information,
    refer to the latest Open vSwitch w/ DPDK deployment guide.
