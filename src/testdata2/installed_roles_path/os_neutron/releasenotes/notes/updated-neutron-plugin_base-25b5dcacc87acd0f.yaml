upgrade:
  - The ``neutron_plugin_base`` variable has been modifed to use the friendly
    names. Deployers should change any customisations to this variable to
    ensure that the customisation makes use of the short names instead of
    the full class path.
  - Database migration tasks have been added for the LBaaS neutron plugin.
deprecations:
  - The old class path names used within the ``neutron_plugin_base``
    have been deprecated in favor of the friendly names. Support for the use
    of the class path plugins will be removed in the OpenStack Newton cycle.
