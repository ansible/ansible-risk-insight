deprecations:

    Support for an Open vSwitch dataplate with NSH support using the
    ``ovs_nsh_support`` variable has been immediately deprecated and
    removed due to built-in support for NSH in recent Open vSwitch
    releases. The prior PPA provided a custom release of OVS 2.9, which
    is no longer appropriate for recent releases of OSA and respective
    operating systems.
