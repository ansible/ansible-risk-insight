features:
  - |
    Support for Neutron distributed virtual routing has been added to the
    ``os_neutron`` role. This includes the implementation of Networking
    Guide's suggested agent configuration. This feature may be activated
    by setting ``neutron_plugin_type: ml2.ovs.dvr`` in ``/etc/openstack_deploy/user_variables.yml``.
upgrade:
  - The variable ``neutron_agent_mode`` has been removed from the
    ``os_neutron`` role. The appropriate value for ``l3_agent.ini`` is now
    determined based on the ``neutron_plugin_type`` and host group membership.
