features:

    The ``provider_networks`` library has been updated to support the
    definition of network interfaces that can automatically be added as ports
    to OVS provider bridges setup during a deployment. To activate this feature,
    add the ``network_interface`` key to the respective flat and/or vlan provider
    network definition in ``openstack_user_config.yml``. For more information,
    refer to the latest Open vSwitch deployment guide.

  - |
    The ``provider_networks`` library has been updated to support the
    definition of network interfaces that can automatically be added as ports
    to OVS provider bridges setup during a deployment. As a result, the
    ``network_interface`` value applied to the ``neutron_provider_networks``
    override in ``user_variables.yml``, as described in previous Open vSwitch
    deployment guides, is no longer effective. If overrides are
    necessary, use ``network_interface_mappings`` within the provider network
    override and specify the respective bridge-to-interface mapping
    (e.g. "br-provider:bond1"). For more information, refer to the latest Open
    vSwitch deployment guide.
