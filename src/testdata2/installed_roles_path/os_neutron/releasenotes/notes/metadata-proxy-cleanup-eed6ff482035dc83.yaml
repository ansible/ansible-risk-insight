fixes:
  - When upgrading it is possible for an old ``neutron-ns-metadata-proxy``
    process to remain running in memory. If this happens the old version of
    the process can cause unexpected issues in a production environment. To
    fix this a task has been added to the os_neutron role that will execute
    a process lookup and kill any ``neutron-ns-metadata-proxy`` processes that
    are not running the current release tag. Once the old processes are
    removed the metadata agent running will respawn everything needed within
    60 seconds.
