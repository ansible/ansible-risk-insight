deprecations:
  - The Neutron HA tool written by AT&T has been deprecated and will be
    removed in the Ocata release.
upgrade:
  - The Neutron HA tool written by AT&T is no longer enabled by default.
    This tool was providing HA capabilities for networks and routers
    that were not using the native Neutron L3HA. Because native Neutron
    L3HA is stable, compatible with the Linux Bridge Agent, and is
    a better means of enabling HA within a deployment this tool is no
    longer being setup by default. If legacy L3HA is needed within a
    deployment the deployer can set `neutron_legacy_ha_tool_enabled` to
    **true** to enable the legacy tooling.
