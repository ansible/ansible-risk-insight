    Support for the networking-generic-switch mechanism driver has been implemented.
    This allows Ironic to interface with Neutron when the ``neutron`` network interface
    has been configured. This feature may be enabled by adding ``ml2.genericswitch``
    to the ``neutron_plugin_types`` list in ``/etc/openstack_deploy/user_variables.yml``.
