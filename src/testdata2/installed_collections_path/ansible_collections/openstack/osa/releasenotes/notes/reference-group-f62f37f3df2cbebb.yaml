features:
  - |
    Support is added for the 'reference_group' provider_networks parameter
    when identifying which net_names and VLAN ranges can be accessed by
    specific hosts. This targets deployments which make use of external
    routed provider networks.
upgrade:
  - |
    Note that 'reference_group' in provider_networks now impacts Neutron agent
    configuration. If net_names or VLAN ranges are defined alongside a
    'reference_group', these will only be applied to hosts which exist in the
    'reference_group'. If 'reference_group' was not used previously then the
    behaviour will be unchanged. This only applies to 'flat' or 'vlan' network
    types.
