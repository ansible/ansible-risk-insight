# Playbook to bootstrap the SoYouStart dedicated servers.  These servers don't have a non-root user
# account when freshly installed.  Running our playbooks as the root user is not an option, since
# geerlingguy.security role disables root login, so we would lock ourselves out.  This playbook
# creates the ubuntu user, gives it the required permissions and disables the password of the root
# user.  The ubuntu user is made accessible with the SSH private key used to run this playbook.
#
# Usage:
#    ansible-playbook bootstrap-dedicated.yml -i <IP address or hostname>, \
#        --private-key=/path/to/ssh/private/key
#
# Note that the comma after the IP address needs to be included.
# The host must also be a part of a group called 'dedicated' in the inventory.
