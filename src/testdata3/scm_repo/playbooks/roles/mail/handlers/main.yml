# https://docs.mailman3.org/projects/mailman/en/latest/src/mailman/docs/mta.html#transport-maps
# > Mailman will automatically write the correct transport map when its mailman aliases command is run,
# > or whenever a mailing list is created or removed via other commands.
#
# So we have this here as a handler to be called when mailman is installed, updated, config changed, etc. from ansible.
# In normal operation, mailman will keep it up to date automatically.
#
# This generates the maps databases used by postfix in /var/lib/mailman3/data/

# Update the transport file database.
# This should be run whenever /etc/postfix/transport is changed.

# Update the aliases database.
# This should be run whenever /etc/aliases is changed.

# This should be last in the file;
# So that it's reloaded _after_ transport db, etc. are updated.
