Community
=========

DebOps has a small but active community of developers and users. Come on in and
say hi!

DebOps monorepo
---------------

Main development of the project is done in its :command:`git` monorepo, using
a distributed development model. The default location of the monorepo is the
`DebOps GitHub repository`__, used for the issues and pull requests. There's
also a `read-only mirror on GitLab`__ used to manage the public test pipeline
based on `GitLab CI`__.

The developers and users maintain their own `monorepo forks`__ on GitHub, used
for development and pull requests.

Matrix room
-----------

DebOps has its own room in the `Matrix`__ network, `#debops:matrix.org`__. You
can access it over the Web or via a mobile app using the `Element`__ Matrix
client. Matrix provides us with notifications from GitHub about new issues and
pull requests in the DebOps monorepo.

The room is bridged to the Libera.Chat IRC channel, so both communities can talk
to each other.

IRC channels
------------

The ``#debops`` IRC channel on the `Libera.Chat`__ IRC network can be used to
talk about DebOps, Debian, Ansible and general sysadmin related stuff. Feel
free to come over and say hello. The channel is bridged to the DebOps room on
the Matrix network, so both communities can talk with each other.

The ``#debops`` IRC channel on the reeNode IRC network has been active for
almost as long as the DebOps project itself. Unfortunately with recent change
of Freenode ownership it had to be retired. Come over to the Libera.Chat or
Matrix networks for a chat.


Mailing list
------------

The DebOps project has `its own mailing list`__, ``debops-users``, based on
Mailman. The list has low traffic and is used for notifications about
significant changes in the project, and more asynchronous communication. You
can also check out the `mailing list archives`__.

The /r/debops subreddit
-----------------------

The DebOps project has its own `/r/debops`__ subreddit on the `Reddit`__
website. Come over to talk about the project and post interesting links related
to DebOps.
