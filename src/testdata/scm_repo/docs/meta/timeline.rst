Timeline
========

This document is a summary of the DebOps development over time. You can see
most of the project's history in :command:`git` logs, however tracing it might
be confusing due to the split and subsequent merge of the code back together.
Here, we try to explain why that happened.


Summary of the events
---------------------

The project has been initiated by Maciej Delmanowski in October 2013. In
September 2014, after two project name changes, the code contained in one
:command:`git` repository was moved into multiple :command:`git` repositories
published in the `debops`__ organization on GitHub to allow publication of the
roles in the `Ansible Galaxy`__, as well as better usage of Travis CI to test
the codebase.

.. __: https://github.com/debops/
.. __: https://galaxy.ansible.com/debops/

The decision to move the project codebase to the separate :command:`git`
repositories shaped the DebOps project in multiple ways. It enforced the code
separation between different Ansible roles that required development of proper
ways to make them interact with each other and pass the data around. New open
source projects, `ansigenome`__ and `rolespec`__, were created to aid the
DebOps development and maintenance.

.. __: https://github.com/nickjj/ansigenome/
.. __: https://github.com/nickjj/rolespec/

Unfortunately, the growing codebase resulted in quickly rising number of
:command:`git` repositories to maintain, which sapped the available resources
from project development. There were also issues with packaging the DebOps code
and documentation in Debian, as well as no practical way to provide a "stable
release" due to the separate :command:`git` repositories being independently
tagged and developed. Because of that, in August 2017 the project maintainers
decided to merge all of the :command:`git` repositories back into one monorepo
to make the DebOps development easier.

The process was completed over a period of a few months. As the result, the
development model also changed into a more distributed way with multiple forks
of the main repository. First official stable release was published in
May 2019.


2013
----

May 2013
~~~~~~~~

- `Debian 7.0 (wheezy)`__ becomes a Debian Stable release. It was the first
  Debian release supported by DebOps.

~~~~~~~~~~~~

- `Initial commit`__ in the ``ansible-aiua`` :command:`git` repository which
  will eventually become DebOps.

2015
----

February 2015
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- `debops-playbooks v0.1.0`__ is released. This repository holds the DebOps
  playbooks that tie all of the roles together, and was treated as the "main"

September 2015
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- After `discussion in the community`__ role dependency model in DebOps is

  :file:`meta/main.yml` configuration to the playbook level to allow easy use
  of various DebOps roles independently from each other.

April 2016
~~~~~~~~~~

- Daniel Sender creates the first iteration of the `debops`__ Debian package.
  Unfortunately, problems with `debops-doc package`__ prevent full inclusion of
  the project in Debian.

2017
----

June 2017
~~~~~~~~~

- `Debian 9.0 (stretch)`__ becomes a Debian Stable release.

.. __: https://www.debian.org/releases/stretch/

August 2017
~~~~~~~~~~~

- Maciej Delmanowski `proposes merge of all of the project repositories`__ back
  together into one DebOps monorepo. The plan is to resolve all pending pull
  requests in various repositories before merging starts.

.. __: https://lists.debops.org/hyperkitty/list/debops-users@lists.debops.org/thread/E25T2ZZHRPU3JSKT5DLJXICGSJO3B6M4/

September 2017
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- `debops-tools v0.5.0`__ was the last tagged release of the DebOps scripts
  before the repository was merged into the new DebOps monorepo.

.. __: https://github.com/debops/debops/tree/23e8723aab

October 2017
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- `The last commit`__ in the ``debops-playbooks`` :command:`git` repository.
  Later on the repository will be merged into the new DebOps monorepo.

.. __: https://github.com/debops/debops/commit/fb04a87064

- `All of the pending pull requests in DebOps roles are resolved`__ and the
  code from separate :command:`git` repositories is merged into `single monorepo`__,
  which becomes the main development repository.

.. __: https://lists.debops.org/hyperkitty/list/debops-users@lists.debops.org/thread/SG2GHX7A7TMBBD7AI3N3YRFRRGI67LP7/
.. __: https://github.com/debops/debops

- `debops v0.6.0`__ is released, along with updated scripts that support
  installation of the monorepo by the :command:`debops-update` command. The
  release is fully compatible with older DebOps roles and playbooks. From this
  point on the old and new codebases start to diverge.

.. __: https://github.com/debops/debops/tree/1250d75c91

- `ypid roles from 'debops-contrib' organization are merged`__ to the DebOps
  monorepo without further changes; they will be integrated with the main
  playbook later on.

.. __: https://github.com/debops/debops/tree/1c884c0af4

November 2017
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- `Sphinx-based documentation is reinitialized`__ in the monorepo. Previous
  iteration based on a central :command:`git` repository and :command:`git`
  submodules is deemed unsuitable, however current project documentation
  published on ReadTheDocs is kept in place, waiting before role documentation
  is fully migrated.

.. __: https://github.com/debops/debops/tree/89dd6fe1a3

- `New Travis CI test suite is introduced`__ that focuses on syntax, testing
  Python scripts, YAML documents, project documentation and :command:`git`
  repository integrity. DebOps roles are not tested directly on Travis anymore.

.. __: https://github.com/debops/debops/tree/6a4da14c60

- `Support for Docker containers is introduced`__ in the monorepo, along with
  an `official 'debops/debops' Docker image`__ which is automatically rebuilt
  and published on any changes in the repository.

.. __: https://github.com/debops/debops/tree/18830a614e
.. __: https://hub.docker.com/r/debops/debops/

December 2017
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- `New test suite based on GitLab CI is introduced`__ which allows testing of
  the DebOps roles using Vagrant, LXC and KVM/libvirt stack.

.. __: https://github.com/debops/debops/tree/a879a82d5a


2018
----

  monorepo version.
