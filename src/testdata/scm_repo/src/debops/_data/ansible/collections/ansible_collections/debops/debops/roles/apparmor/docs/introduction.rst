Introduction
============

.. include:: includes/all.rst

AppArmor is able to restrict what programs can do and access based on policies
for those programs.

See `AppArmor in the Debian Wiki <https://wiki.debian.org/AppArmor/HowToUse>`_.

By default (e.â€¯g. no auditd_ installed) log messages from AppArmor are logged
via syslog to the kernel facility which usually ends up under
:file:`/var/log/kern.log`.
