  # Directory where additional configuration files not related to existing or
  # packaged services will be stored. Very rarely used.
  - name: 'etc'
    path: '/usr/local/etc'

  # Directory where various scripts which don't or shouldn't be directly
  # accessible from the interactive shell should be stored, so that they don't
  # pollute Tab-completion. Roles can create subdirectories here in case when
  # more than a handful of scripts are used.

  # the '/usr/share' directory. Rarely used.

  # Path where application sources (tarballs, 'git' repositories) can be stored
  # and operated on, usually in a separate subdirectory for each role or user.

  # in separate subdirectories for each user/role.
