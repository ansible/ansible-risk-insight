Example inventory
-----------------

To setup and configure Firejail on a given host it should be included in the
``debops_service_firejail`` Ansible inventory group:

.. code:: ini

   [debops_service_firejail]
   hostname

Example playbook
----------------

Here's an example playbook that uses the ``debops-contrib.firejail`` role:

.. literalinclude:: playbooks/firejail.yml
   :language: yaml
   :lines: 1,5-

The playbooks is shipped with this role under
:file:`./docs/playbooks/firejail.yml` from which you can symlink it to your
playbook directory.
In case you use multiple `DebOps Contrib`_ roles, consider using the
`DebOps Contrib playbooks`_.

Ansible tags
------------

You can use Ansible ``--tags`` or ``--skip-tags`` parameters to limit what
tasks are performed during Ansible run. This can be used after a host was first
configured to speed up playbook execution, when you are sure that most of the
configuration is already in the desired state.

Available role tags:

``role::firejail``
  Main role tag, should be used in the playbook to execute all of the role
  tasks as well as role dependencies.

``role::firejail:pkgs``
  Tasks related to system package management like installing or
  removing packages.

``role::firejail:profile``
  Tasks related to Firejail security profile management like copying or
  removing profile files.
