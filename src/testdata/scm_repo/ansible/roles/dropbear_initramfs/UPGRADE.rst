From systemli.rootcrypto_
-------------------------

All inventory variables have been renamed so you might need to update your
inventory.
A subset of them can be automatically updated using this script:

.. literalinclude:: scripts/migrate-from-systemli.rootcrypto-to-debops-contrib.dropbear_initramfs
   :language: shell
   :lines: 1,6-

The script is bundled with this role under
:file:`./docs/scripts/migrate-from-systemli.rootcrypto-to-debops-contrib.dropbear_initramfs`
and can be invoked from there.

You will need to read the role documentation and upgrade your remaining
inventory manually.
